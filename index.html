(if:$trigFlag is 1)[(set:$trigFlag to 0)(save-game:&quot;starterSave&quot;)]
No matter how hard you try, you can never truly escape your position in The Abyss.

While your father and his army of bureaucrats spend their solstice toiling away in the extravagant, scorching halls of the core, you have retreated towards the surface, finding some respite in the dark, barren tunnels of the Abyssal Dungeon. Father has never //approved// of your escapades, but the imps who guard the dungeon have grown a fondness for your company. While you have no need for their protection, companionship is hard to come by for you, so you don&#39;t mind. 

One of your biggest hassles as the Demon King&#39;s daughter comes from your father&#39;s delegated paperwork. Since your father has co-opted your escapism into his logistical schemes, messengers usually bother &#39;&#39;you&#39;&#39; when they don&#39;t want to wait in line at the core. Today, it&#39;s a stout, eagle-headed fiend. He most likely represents the aggressive party in some petty squabble between a couple of merchants. You don&#39;t particularly care. You&#39;ve never been given much of a choice in this.

You take the quill from his hand and on the line you sloppily sign...

Mind you, you aged out of these tastes, especially since the palace doesn&#39;t even have a functioning ballroom.



And... there weren&#39;t... really many suitors, either...

You marveled at the herbs he had managed to cultivate under the harsh conditions of the Abyssal Core. 

You always assumed the garden was kept so secret because your father used it for poison, or something equally pernicious. One day, as you were harvesting herbs together, he admitted the truth: Your father kept the garden as a sanctum of sorts, the lone place he could escape his guards.

You missed that side of him as you grew older and saw it less...

When your time came, you took the name Basilia, declaring yourself the one herb which The Abyss grew in secret to even //him//.

Every new reference to a character you&#39;d been studying left your mind racing with possibility. In your youth, you searched hundreds of rows in the archives, searching out the dozen or so books mentioning Dionne, the titaness who birthed the goddess of love.

When the time came, you, rather indulgently, took the titaness&#39;s name, perhaps in hope that, some day, your name may too sparsely dot the shelves of the archives, waiting only for someone intent on finding it.

When the time came, you took the name Freyja, with the intent to fulfill these aspirations. It would take longer than you could fathom, but you had to keep that bed of clouds at the back of your mind to continue the fight in your darkest hours.

Thus you took the name Irina, both to embody her boldness and to better understand the feelings you had once grappled with.

Without really noticing, you projected your own fears onto Lilith, wondering what would happen to you, were you to stand up for yourself like she had...

That, of course, was not the life that had been laid before you, but you could never shake the temptation to follow in her footsteps.

You crush up the largest piece, it gives rather easily under your finger. It&#39;s a tad messy working in your hands alone, but the shrooms easily grind together into an oily, sweet-smelling paste.

You&#39;ve never exactly checked how one administers wormwood to a human, so you follow your normal application pattern and hope for the best. You say a silent apology as you remove the woman&#39;s gauntlets and helm, portioning a small dot of the mixture onto each of her wrists, and spreading the remainder on her neck. While it&#39;s not as effective as ethereal magic, it should help reverse any permanent damage you could have done.

You disarm the woman and sit back at the edge of the room, waiting for her to wake, and trying extremely hard to //not// think about her gentle, clawless hands or her smooth, golden skin, and especially not the way that either felt to your touch. You do **everything** in your power to not think about these things.]

After a few minutes of quiet, she shows no sign of stirring, and your eyes start to feel heavy. &quot;You&#39;ve definitely got enough exertion in for one morning&quot;, your body coos to you, enticing you into the dark. One momentary lapse in judgment later, and you&#39;re out cold in the corner of the garden. (set:$Con to it + 1)

[[There&#39;s no way this could backfire. -&gt;hCAwakening]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="hCButBondage" tags="" position="4100,2800" size="100,100">While you didn&#39;t pack any rope or bindings today, that&#39;s nothing a quick cantrip can&#39;t fix. You heft the armored lass and carry her towards the corner of the garden, trying to place her somewhat comfortably as you wrap her arms around a support beam and start a low chant, calling into the darkness. Particles of shadow stream from across the room, dancing up the woman&#39;s armor and across her hands, forming a long coil of tenebrous binding.
From then... well... you wait.
You feel a bit awkward just hovering around this woman, so you busy yourself in the opposite corner, tending to the garden to take your mind off of your current situation. (set: $Wis to it + 1)

You hear some stirring from the opposite corner, so you kneel down next to the woman. She&#39;s... still out cold, but has seemingly fallen from your... uh.. manual unconsciousness into a fitful slumber of her own.
In her sleep, she&#39;s rocking side to side, breathing heavily. She begins to call out for someone...
&quot;Euphemia...? E-Euphie are you there...? Euphie, please, Euphie answer-&quot;

It is at this point that, in your fascination, you let your focus wander, and your breathing trails, and, unbeknownst to you, the gentle rhythm that&#39;s been the backing track for this entire moment goes mute.

Right after, the woman rouses from her slumber. You see her fearful stare for only a second before her hands are around your throat.
Unfortunately for you, she has the advantage in raw strength, and she&#39;s pinned you.
&quot;What the hell are you doing? Who...-&quot;
Her voice trails off some as she looks around and remembers where she is, and she deflates, somewhat.

&quot;I... well...&quot;
The poor girl bites her lip. Can humans just never speak in full sentences?

&quot;I will assume, that you&#39;re a denizen of this... place, er, dungeon? Wherever we are currently. What exactly was your goal in subduing me? Are you planning on taking me prisoner for your king? Were you going to put me into a stew?&quot;
In the seconds it takes you to work through her slew of oddly specific questions, the woman removes her helmet entirely, giving her fiery eyes proper room to stare into your soul.

|gayGuard)[Her grip loosens on your throat.
&quot;That&#39;s... surprisingly noble of you... uh... demonic... filth...&quot;
She is visibly struggling to even call you this epithet. Her eyes have shot down to the floor. You could even find this shrinking violet act adorable, if this woman didn&#39;t currently have you pinned to the floor.

&quot;Hey... you can, like, let me go if you want. I don&#39;t want to bring the guards here.&quot;
While you wouldn&#39;t like to cause any undue bloodshed, you also //really// wouldn&#39;t like to compromise your favorite hiding place.

&quot;Oh, I... right, sorry..&quot; She stammers, removing her steel frame from your legs.
&quot;I... uh... I guess I just got a little paranoid. I feel like hitting me was... a bit much, but you probably could have just killed me if you actually planned to..&quot;
(You //do// still feel bad for that entire ordeal, you&#39;re really not sure what very ancient part of your brain awoke at the idea of hitting someone with a big rock.)

She places herself back in the corner where you&#39;d restrained her, her chin balanced on her knees.
You close in a little to ask your next question, but she cuts you off, stammering out an answer before you can even ask:

&quot;I&#39;m... uh... Ariadne... of Eresos. I&#39;m a knight, back in my home... and... and I&#39;ve come to kill the Demon King!&quot; (set: $bondageFlag to 1)

You wipe your eyes and stare into the dim light of the gardens. You&#39;re sprawled across the floor with a heavy cloth spread across your chest. Across the room, you see the armored woman, sitting cross-legged and staring at you intently.

You pull off the cloth, and, in doing so, recognize it as some sort of flowing cloak. You curse yourself for doubting the value of human fashion, but there are more pressing issues. Your //patient// breaks the silence.

&quot;I... uhm... I know what you did...&quot; She isn&#39;t making eye contact, but she&#39;s got a soft smile on her face.

&quot;Once I realized I&#39;d been hit, I figured I wouldn&#39;t be waking up... I guess I always expected your types to be more ruthless.&quot; She steps closer, and you flush a little at her words. (&quot;You didn&#39;t murder someone you&#39;ve just met.&quot; isn&#39;t high praise, but it still gives you a warm feeling.)

&quot;Uhm... I guess it&#39;s a little late for introductions, but I&#39;m Ariadne... I&#39;m from Eresos.&quot; She puts out her hand and smiles at you.


...


You shake yourself.

&quot;I&#39;m... uh... $Name... I&#39;m from... well, I&#39;m //from// the Abyssal Core.&quot; You take her hand and pulling yourself up to meet her.

&quot;$Name... That&#39;s a pretty name.&quot; Ariadne flushes somewhat and places her face in her hands. 

&quot;Wow, I... uhm... sorry, that&#39;s probably an overstep. I don&#39;t know your culture and ho-&quot; she&#39;s talking far too fast, but you cut her off.

&quot;It&#39;s fine, and... uh... thanks... for... uh...&quot; You gesture to her cloak on the ground, and you both take a silent beat to cool yourselves before Ariadne speaks up again.

&quot;Uh... well... $Name, I... I want to thank you for your kindness, and... I know this is going to sound strange. Still, I don&#39;t think I have any other options... I would like to request your assistance...&quot; You question how you&#39;ve moved from bludgeoning this woman to having her ask you favors so quickly, but you don&#39;t mind. You //do// still feel bad about that rock incident.

&quot;You... uhm... you said you were from the core. Well, I... sort of need to... uhm...  get there? I know... I get that it&#39;s a huge ask, but... I **know** that I couldn&#39;t make it there alone, and... nobody I&#39;ve met in this place has even spoken to me between attempted murders, much less tended to my wounds when I was unconscious... I just...&quot; her voice trails to nothing without even finishing her thought.

Your mouth falls open in your stunned silence.

This woman, who you have just attempted to murder and then felt sorry for, wants you to join her on her journey... the scariest part to you isn&#39;t the strangeness, but that, looking into her pleading eyes, you... almost want to say yes... 

Maybe she could give you some answers... about the outside world... or... about...

Instead, the first thing that comes from your foolish mouth is:

&quot;Well... why do you need to reach the core?&quot; And after some deliberating, Ariadne, seemingly becoming instantly self aware, winces and tells you:

&quot;I need to kill Demon King Orion.&quot;

[[&quot;Oh, that&#39;s reasonab- wait fucking **what**?&quot; -&gt;soMuchToLose]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="thusSheSpake" tags="" position="4400,2700" size="100,100">&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, Ms. $Name... I... Well I just wanted to be honest with you...&quot; Ariadne slumps to the floor, her face in her hands.

&quot;I guess I&#39;ve... never really said my mission out loud to hear how I&#39;d sound... I shouldn&#39;t have assumed you&#39;d be okay with it... I&#39;m... I&#39;m just sorry...&quot;

You don&#39;t know what drives you to it... but you kneel down beside her and place your hand on her shoulder.

Ariadne looks up at you, attempting and failing to wipe tears from her eyes. She falters when she tries to stand, and she kneels to make herself level with you, before bowing her head in your direction.

She takes in a long, labored breath, her cheeks still streaming tears.

&quot;M-Ms. (print:$Name&#39;s 1st)-$Name... I, Ariadne of Eresos humbly request your guidance to the Abyssal Core... and no further.. that, if I may fail... if... if I do... it will be my fault alone... That is... that... that is-&quot; At this point, she becomes a totally incomprehensible mess of wailing and sobbing.

She must be under a lot of pressure... coming somewhere totally alien on what is basically a suicide mission... It hurts to see her like this.

Ariadne keeps trying to finish her proposal, but she can never get the words out. Your heart feels like it&#39;s going to break. You can&#39;t stop yourself.

You scoot closer to this inconsolable knight, and you wrap your arms around her. She seems taken aback, but she returns the gesture. The two of you sit for a while, on the floor of the fungal garden, surrounded by light in a wordless embrace, until Ariadne has cried all the tears she could cry.

&quot;No! I... I mean... no... it&#39;s okay... thank you for that, Ms. $Name. I... I haven&#39;t done well to keep my composure around you... I&#39;m uhm... sorry for that.&quot; She gives you an awkward half smile with her apology, and you return it, without successfully meeting her gaze.

&quot;I... I mean what I said, by the way... I understand if you still must condemn me, but I... I wouldn&#39;t ask you to take on my own curse. I only need guidance to the Abyssal Core... no further.&quot; She twirls her hair around her finger as she speaks, seemingly to busy herself from thinking about what you might say.

You&#39;re... torn. You don&#39;t want harm to befall this woman... but... this feels rather extreme. You aren&#39;t sure if taking her to the core would even be okay... but, when you open your mouth, that isn&#39;t what comes out.

[&quot;Okay... to the core... no further. I can do that.&quot;]&lt;sheSaidYes|(click:?sheSaidYes)[==Ariadne looks at you in disbelief. For a few seconds, the two of you stand wordlessly.

Then, she charges across the room and wraps her arms around you tightly, whispering her thanks dozens of times into your shoulder. It is, frankly, almost painful. Ariadne has clearly never skipped out on training, and she&#39;s not particularly gentle. You accept her embrace anyway.

The two of you have... quite the road ahead of you. But, for now, bathing in the neon light of these fungal gardens, you feel... oddly content.

&lt;h2&gt;-230 km: A Trial For Two&lt;/h2&gt;

You&#39;ve always taken The Abyss&#39;s rapid transport system for granted. The distance from the core to the Abyssal Dungeon typically never crosses your mind.

But that&#39;s all changed, because now you&#39;re escorting a human. Ariadne&#39;s entire being would be destroyed if she took any of your routes, so the only way back down is the long way.

The hardest part was calming Ariadne&#39;s nerves so she wouldn&#39;t jump at any passing guard. You gave her a strict &quot;No Extraordinary Violence&quot; policy. In a stroke of unusual luck, you packed a change of clothes which help hide your decidedly non-Abyssal companion. With Ariadne stretching the arms on your &quot;I hate my entire body and want to become a blob&quot; robes, the two of you could safely begin the long process of descending The Abyss.

Your walk through the Abyssal Dungeon is mostly quiet. 

After a few hours passed with no imps to be seen, Ariadne tells you that she had intentionally been keeping silent as the guards might be suspicious if they heard her speaking Common.

You have to stop walking when you double over in tears of laughter. Ariadne pouts while you explain that, no, demons don&#39;t just constantly speak in Abyssal, but, some time after, she stops you again.

That was **far** too close. 

You don&#39;t notice it at the time, but even once you&#39;re safely out of the line of fire, you don&#39;t let go of Ariadne. You cling to her for dear life. Maybe you&#39;re scared an errant arrow would hit her and you want to block it, maybe you&#39;re just scared and need someone close.

When did you even get so protective of this human? 

You have no idea, but, in the moment, you can&#39;t make yourself let go of her. You&#39;re terrified by the prospect of her getting hurt, even more than you fear for your own safety. After the arrows stop, you stay with her for a little while. She hasn&#39;t made a peep since she first stepped on the trap.

The threat finally over, you lay Ariadne down, gently, and roll over to catch your breath. You rise to your knees and look over, expecting to see Ariadne stuttering some thanks to you. 

Instead, she doesn&#39;t move, lying where you left her, her entire body convulsing. (show:?ariCalm)] |bodyBlockHer)[
You quickly move into position in front of Ariadne, facing her. You begin humming a short sequence of notes as she stares at you, wide-eyed. 

Specks of light from every torch in the room fall to the ground, and the Aether pools them at your feet. You step into the light, and it stretches up your body, wreathing you in a radiant aura.

You grab Ariadne, encircling her with your arms and tail, shielding her just enough to block the arrows&#39; line of fire.

For several minutes, you stand over Ariadne, enveloping her in blinding light, shrugging off arrows with nothing but a dull, throbbing pain. You devote all your focus to steadying your breathing.



When the barrage finally ends, the light around you fades, and [[you collapse, limp, into Ariadne&#39;s arms.-&gt;starsZero]]] |shieldHer)[
You leap into action, moving directly in front of Ariadne. You hum a chain of a few notes, and globs of dark rush inwards from all corners of the room, surrounding the two of you in an inky cocoon. You stand perfectly still, focusing all your attention into stabilizing your breathing. All around, you hear the clamor of arrows bouncing off the darkness. You do your best to ignore them, just as you do your best to ignore the wide eyed stare Ariadne is giving you.

After several minutes of teeth-grinding effort, the arrows finally stop. With one errant breath, the shield collapses, [[as do you.-&gt;starsZero]]] |diveHer)[
You jump to the ground in front of Ariadne. She takes a beat and dives down after you, covering her head with her hands.

As soon as she hits the floor, dozens of arrows fly overhead, just barely missing the tops of your heads.

The two of you cower for several minutes. While you doubt the efficacy of Dad wasting so many arrows, you have to admit, you&#39;re still scared to stand back up, even after you&#39;re 100% certain that the arrows have stopped. 

When you finally do stand, Ariadne doesn&#39;t get up with you. You look over and see her, still balled up on the ground, violently convulsing. (show: ?ariCalm)

Fearing the worst, you pull back Ariadne&#39;s hood and you find her... sobbing. 

She&#39;s safe, just **very** shaken. 

You&#39;re far more relieved than you&#39;d admit to yourself. You lay down next to her and take her hand in yours, to try and signal your presence without startling her. When you squeeze her hand, she looks up at you, knelt over her, gently patting her back with your off hand.

&quot;Shhhh, shhhh, hey... it&#39;s going to be okay, Ariadne...&quot; You don&#39;t exactly know &#39;&#39;how&#39;&#39; to help her, so you just try your best to support her and let her recover on her own.

Over the next few minutes, the convulsions die down, and her tears slowly stop coming.

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry... (print: $Name&#39;s 1st)-$Name... I just... I.. I ju-&quot; You&#39;ve seen this before. You instinctively cut her off to wrap your arms around her. You&#39;ve got her. She&#39;s going to be okay. Ariadne lays her head on your shoulder, and you can feel her slowly stabilize her breathing. When it gets steady, you loosen your grip on her, and the two of you separate.

&quot;I... Wow. That was... way too close for comfort... $Name... I&#39;m glad I had you here to help... I do wish you didn&#39;t have to see me like this so often, though...&quot;

&quot;Uh... is it something I said..?&quot; When you ask this, Ariadne&#39;s face flushes bright red, and she immediately scrambles up.

&quot;Oh, uh, wow, uhm, look at the time, we really need to keep going to stay on pace, we can&#39;t have... uh... far to go!&quot; You ignore that Ariadne hasn&#39;t appeared to have any timekeeping device yet, and you ignore her scrunching up the front of her hood.

As you reach the tail end of the Abyssal Dungeon, the danger gets extremely sparse. You rarely, if ever, come this way, since the express travel point lets out so much closer to the surface.

&quot;This place looks... a lot older... are we near the end, $Name...?&quot; Ariadne has a good sense for these sorts of things. You probably wouldn&#39;t have guessed that, in her shoes.

Either way... Ariadne is about to go further than her entire species ever has... 

You just hope she can keep it together.

After an hour or so of near silent walking, you finally reach the last room of the dungeon. At the end, an intricate iron door towers over you both, with handles rusted from disuse.

A couple years back, wandering through the waterways would entail a lot of trudging through knee-high streams, probably some leeches, and a large variety of poisons. Luckily, the area has become something of a haven for eccentrics and those deemed degenerate. You spent a lot of time here growing up. Now you mostly stop by when you pick up your medicine, but everyone is always so kind to you here. Even if the people here knew you before your time, they don&#39;t treat you any different for it.

The main gate from the dungeon is a couple hours from the waterways proper, since everything accumulated around the express travel  point, but that just gives you more time to tell Ariadne about what&#39;s ahead. Her eyes always light up when she listens to your stories.

In all your prior visits to the town in the waterways, you&#39;d never paid much attention to The Armory.
Any weapons you&#39;ve ever needed, Dad has been able to supply you. As such, you never learned much about the fine art of buying weapons.
But Ariadne? She seemed like her heart was going to burst.
At every stall, she goes down the full catalogue of options, marveling at the craftsmanship put into even the simplest daggers. You trail behind Ariadne, since it&#39;s hard to keep up with her pace, and you catch up to her nearly drooling over a absurdly glamorous silver rapier.

&quot;You know, I never figured fencing would be your thing, what with that massive thing you were swinging around before.&quot; Ariadne jumps at your presence. She was certainly transfixed.

You always feel a tad uncomfortable at The Tailors, like every single customer is sizing you up. It&#39;s the one place in the waterways where you feel... well... the way you feel everywhere else. Today, however, you have Ariadne with you, which leads to a slightly different kind of judgment, but she still puts you at ease.

Ariadne seems to take a little //too// much pleasure in making you try on all sorts of dresses and accessories for her. She says she&#39;s too nervous to wear normal clothing in this place, which you doubt, but you somehow can&#39;t turn her down each time she comes to you with a new outfit.

Besides... even if it&#39;s a bit of a hassle... modeling for Ariadne makes you feel... real? Warm, as well? They&#39;re separate feelings, and their confluence is a sickeningly powerful mood-booster. Enough so that you agree to let her buy you an outfit.

In the end, the two of you agree on something modest enough for you to feel safe, but bold enough for Ariadne&#39;s nose to bleed a little when you first put it on for her. You typically prefer to be as plain as possible to avoid attention, but you doubt anybody will harass a well guarded princess over a skirt slightly puffier than her normal wear. 

As you leave, you //do// notice Ariadne sticking a bit closer to you than before... You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s intentional, but it makes you feel... safe... (show:?andThen)

The Arcanum is something of a break from the noise of the waterways.

Set away from the rest of the market, it&#39;s the home of hundreds of books, each wall lined with tomes of all kinds, all intricately organized. The Arcanum lacks the sheer scope and catalogue of the royal archives, but it makes up for that with its atmosphere. More importantly for you, this is a place you can show to Ariadne.

The two of you bounce around different categories and genres. Every once in a while, you shoot a look across the room to see the kinds of books Ariadne is picking out. A couple times, you catch her doing the same. Eventually, you both converge and reach for the same book. When your hands meet, you immediately yield and apologize, getting a small laugh from Ariadne.

Your shopping concluded, the two of you wander the street for some time. When you&#39;re alone, you usually move from task to task as quickly as possible, but... showing Ariadne the sights... you feel the need to take your time and appreciate everything the city has to offer. 

As you meander around the market district, you hear a man&#39;s voice call out to you. You turn to see an aging fiend behind a grocer&#39;s cart, waving for you. Ariadne raises an eyebrow and puts her hand to her belt. While you appreciate her reaching for a dagger and not her greatsword, you shake your head and excuse yourself.

The Apollonian Daisy is light, but it seems to bear down on your heart itself. It&#39;s certainly one of The Abyss&#39;s most unique flowers. It&#39;s petals pulsate and shine with a gorgeous emerald light... You could almost appreciate its beauty, if your mind had any space devoid of curses and fear. The only place you can safely keep it is in your breast pocket. Eirenus would have a fit at you holding it so close to your heart, but imagining his reaction only makes things worse.

You walk back to Ariadne, and she welcomes you with a honeyed smile, which doesn&#39;t help your frightful condition.

&quot;So... any important business, $shortName?&quot; She&#39;s twirling her hair in her finger, and words fail you for a moment.

The silence, too, seems to exist only to make you even more nervous.

&quot;So, should we get goi-&quot; You instantly drop your gaze to the ground.

&quot;That&#39;s all? I... I would love to, $shortName...

How could I ever turn down a dinner from my ever-so-sweet guide?&quot; You try your absolute hardest to not blush, but, from the sweet look that she gives you, you know you&#39;ve failed miserably. She takes your arm and tugs you forward, some.

The warmth in The Sugar Clove washes over you before you&#39;ve even entered. The air smells faintly of cinnamon, and all the noise that filled the streets outside has been muffled into near silence. You feel like you can breathe easier inside.

&quot;I never expected something like this in the middle of such a town... This feels like it would fit in perfectly on the surface...&quot; Ari gushes about the design of all the cafe&#39;s furniture until you manage to wrangle her to a table.

Around you, dozens of tables are filled with various fiends and demons chatting amongst themselves or reading. Luckily, they seem far too absorbed to even need an excuse for Ariadne&#39;s behavior.

&quot;You know... I usually only come here to read... so this is... a nice change of pace.&quot; You try to stay composed, but Ari performs a secret human technique, and, as you release your nervous energy into idly tapping the table, she takes your hand in hers.

Your moment is interrupted by a small tut from a staff member.

&quot;Oh dear, if it isn&#39;t Ms. $Name. To what do we owe the honor?&quot; A tall fiend approaches and gives a mocking bow.

&quot;Oh, uh.. hey Xana... this is Ariadne... we&#39;re just here for a meal...&quot; It&#39;s hard to talk much with Xanaphos staring you down. They&#39;ve got just a few too many eyes, all attached to a brain that&#39;s come to know you a //bit// too well over the years.

You don&#39;t particularly like that they&#39;re right. Luckily, they leave you be after taking down some drinks for the both of you. Xana is silent when they return with Ari&#39;s coffee and your tea, and Ari breaks the silence once they&#39;re out of earshot..

&quot;Uhm... what did they mean about your study? If... if it&#39;s not prying...&quot; Ari twirls her hair in her finger. She always seems very scared to ask you too many personal questions. You probably shouldn&#39;t tell her all that you do, but... you just can&#39;t help it with her.

Ariadne takes the daisy from your hand, marveling at its glow. She has a gentle two handed hold on it, as if it could snap at any second. She rolls the stem under her fingers as she stares into the flower&#39;s glowing core. (show:?theMeans)](theGift|[You rise and circle the table to stand over Ariadne.

You place your hand under her chin. She flushes at your touch. Brushing a stray lock of hair behind Ari&#39;s ear, you pin the flower with it.

Under the soft light of The Sugar Clove and the glow of the Apollonian Daisy, Ariadne looks... fragile... You&#39;re afraid that if you hold on too hard, she&#39;ll shatter. Even still, you don&#39;t want to let go...

You take Ari&#39;s hand in yours and give it a brief kiss(if: $caffeine is 1)[, partially as your payback for earlier].

Ari is grinning beneath through her tears. You think you see some other patrons tearing up as well. (set:$tenderFlower to 1)(show:?theMeans)](theTendies|[

You wrap her in a hug to break her cocoon, and she rests her head on your shoulder. You hear Ari muttering both apologies and thanks between her light sobs. You slow her down with a brief kiss on the cheek, after which she is mostly silent, instead simply holding you much tighter.

Once you come back to your senses, you both blushedly return to your chairs where you both sit in an unbelieving silence. Your nervous tension is broken by the sound of a plate on your table.

Xanaphos has brought you a free dessert.

You both find this far more amusing than you should, and you enjoy your last fully prepared meal for some time.(show:?CafeConc)](godYEEES|[Ari doesn&#39;t need to hear any more than that, and she already has you in another one of her tackle-hugs.

You spend a couple more hours in the cafe, telling stories just a bit too loudly for others&#39; comfort. You don&#39;t notice in the moment, nor do your eyes ever stray from Ari for too long. Every once in a while, Ariadne remembers the daisy and she cries about it a little more. It&#39;s during one of these cries that you finally decide to bring her out of the cafe. 

The two of you step out into the quiet night air... it seems even the waterways die down eventually... 



When you walk into the slumbering town, Ariadne immediately seems on edge.

&quot;Uhm... $shortName?&quot;

&quot;Yeah? What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Where are we supposed to stay?&quot;

You hadn&#39;t considered. It&#39;s been years since you&#39;ve had to sleep away from home...

&quot;I... think I&#39;ve got... something...&quot; You hold your head for a while. You&#39;d been hoping to stay away to avoid complications, but you need a rest, and, if you need a rest, Ari //definitely// needs one...

There&#39;s stirring from the house. Ari has started leaning on you to keep herself awake. You don&#39;t mind. The door creaks open to reveal a female fiend. She sees you and immediately throws her arms around you. Ari is shaken back into full consciousness, if only for a moment.

&quot;Oh my ~dear~ $Name! It&#39;s been so long!&quot; She&#39;s all smiles. Well, five of them, to be precise.

Ariadne lets out a honeyed laugh. 

&quot;Of course not. Who&#39;d ever be mad to learn they&#39;d been... ahem... traveling... with a princess?&quot; Ari swivels you around so she can look into your eyes.

&quot;How do you know her name, $shortName...?&quot; Ari backs away from you...
She rips a dagger from her belt and points it your way. She&#39;s sobbing.

&quot;Tell me... **Tell me... $shortName...**

This is... different... than the last time she had a blade pointed at you. You aren&#39;t afraid.

You step towards her, and she trembles.

&quot;(print:$Name&#39;s 1st)-$Name...&quot; Her aggressive expression quickly collapses into a mess of snot and tears.

You reach her. She drops her dagger and falls into your arms. You sit with her on Payla&#39;s cheap guest bed and hold her steady while she bawls.

&quot;I... I just miss her so m-much... $Name....&quot;

&quot;I... I never should have trusted that... that t-thing... He... he took her from me... H-he killed Euphemia... I never should have trusted him...&quot; Ari has to stop briefly to wail into your shoulder. You keep her held tight, both for her sake and your own.

&quot;He... h-he led us into a trap... the king... arrived after he walked off... I never saw his damned face again...&quot; Your stomach turns.

&quot;And so... I trained... every day... to finally take revenge for Euphie... on the king... and that... prince... bastard... I&#39;ll make them **both** pay...&quot; A chill shoots down your spine. Something isn&#39;t sitting right with you... but it would only hurt her to ask about it now.

You hold Ari for some time before either of you speak again. She&#39;s clearly... fragile... right now, so you give her time, until she&#39;s cried all her tears. 

You divert Ari&#39;s attention with talk about the day behind you, and she starts to make idle chatter, until she&#39;s stopped thinking about all the things that are hurting her.(show: ?theVow)](pViolence|[
&quot;See... one day... she... Euphie... she found a boy, lost in the woods... He had skin the color of ash, and he said he was from The Abyss...&quot; A lump forms in your throat.

&quot;The elders didn&#39;t like us playing with the boy, but he was always so kind to... to us both...&quot; A sad smile crosses Ari&#39;s face... but it doesn&#39;t last.

&quot;One day... the boy told Euphie and me that his dad was going to come up... that he could teach us some magic...&quot; Ari takes a break to breathe. She squeezes your hands, and you squeeze back to remind her of your presence.

&quot;When we arrived... the boy said he&#39;d go get his dad... so we waited... Not long after... the... the...&quot; Ari trails off into fitful sobbing. You put your arms around her. She weeps on your shoulder until she regains her composure.

&quot;Then the... well... the Demon King... showed up. I&#39;ll never forget his face. He... he smashed Euphie into the ground... He would&#39;ve got me too, if he hadn&#39;t been so loud... some villagers heard him and came running. He was already gone when they arrived...&quot; You feel ill. Something in this isn&#39;t sitting right with you.

&quot;That&#39;s what became of me and Euphie... two town freaks enter, one total pariah leaves...&quot;

&quot;The whole town thought I was //manifesting energies// or something... none of them believed me, even when they knew I&#39;d been around **that boy**... By the time they let me back in... the town was on its last legs... everyone heard of children getting demon powers, and they took off.&quot;



Your mouth is bone dry. You want to run, scream, cry... anything. You just keep listening.

&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here now... to kill the Demon King... his prince... whatever it takes to earn some hollow revenge... maybe I can convince myself it&#39;ll give me back anything I&#39;ve lost...&quot;

&quot;Honestly... I&#39;ve spent longer chasing revenge for Euphie than I&#39;d even known her. I probably would have been content to just die in that dungeon... but then you had to show up...&quot; Ari looks up to you, her eyes brimming with admiration... affection... or something else. You feel some of your worries settle.

&quot;You&#39;ve made this all a lot more complicated for me, y&#39;know...?&quot; Ari gives you a faint smile, and you pull her close. The two of you lay in contented silence as Ariadne dries her tears on your shoulder. (show:?theVow)](theAnomaly|[



You finally break the tension.

Ariadne peers up from her comfortable spot, nested in the crook of your neck, with her arms around your midriff.

&quot;Yes, $shortName?&quot; She laughs. You&#39;re glad she can do that again.
 
&quot;I... I&#39;ve made my choice.&quot; You place a gentle hand on Ari&#39;s cheek, so she doesn&#39;t worry about what you might say next.
 
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m going to stay by your side.&quot; Ariadne&#39;s eyes go wide.

&quot;I&#39;m not particularly fond of him, either... and... if he really did what you said...&quot; You grit your teeth and focus on only what&#39;s around you. Ari&#39;s breathing, your own, the light breeze through the room, anything.

&quot;And.. even if you have to fight... uhm... I assume... your brother?&quot;

Your breathing falters, and you take a beat to consider... Some things are best left unspoken.

[&quot;No matter what.&quot;]&lt;doubleYeet|(click:?doubleYeet)[== Ari&#39;s tears return to their regularly scheduled flow.

&quot;$Name-(print:$Name&#39;s last)-(print:$Name&#39;s last)...&quot; She pouts, but there are stars in her eyes as she looks up to you.



You just wish you could make this moment last forever.
Your hand wanders to cup Ari&#39;s cheek.

The journey ahead will be long. 
Your gaze sneaks down her face, and you feel your heart racing.

You&#39;re ready for it, though. 
Your thumb finds itself over Ari&#39;s bottom lip, as your breath quickens.

Ari is the first to move, pulling you into her for a quick peck. You know enough about Ari to predict that she&#39;ll back away, yell out her apologies, and ask you to strike her down...



You don&#39;t give her the chance.

You place a reassuring hand on Ari&#39;s back, and, when she strikes, you hold her tight. Ari doesn&#39;t need telling twice, and she pulls you in deeper.

While it happens, you barely notice the small sensations. The softness of Ari&#39;s lips, the scent of the light, floral perfume she&#39;s applied, the grip by which Ari clings to you, as if her life depends on your closeness... they all blend together.



For a beautiful, perfect moment, not a single piece of either of your journeys matters. It&#39;s just the two of you, lying together, falling in love in a town with no sun.



When the moment finally ends, Ari buries herself in your shoulder to avoid showing her blushing face. You toy with her hair to soothe her worries. She melts easily into your arms, and the weight of your decision seems to slide right off of you.

Sure... this could be a mistake. You &#39;&#39;did&#39;&#39; basically just agree to fight your dad to the death... but... with Ari around, he doesn&#39;t scare you that much anymore. You rest your head on her shoulder as she calms back down.



&quot;Hey, uhm, $Name...?&quot;
 
[&quot;Yes, Ari?&quot;]&lt;uwu|(click:?uwu)[==
 
&quot;Uh... we never worked out how exactly we were gonna sleep, did we?&quot;

You take a spare blanket and set up right next to the bed. Ari has her fair share of giggles at your choice, but she respects your decision.

Before turning in, you take Ari&#39;s hand.

&quot;Hey... uh... if anything happens, and you need someone... don&#39;t feel bad about waking me, okay...?&quot; Ari bursts into her sweet laughter.

&quot;I&#39;m... glad... for that. Thanks for letting me know, $shortName... And thanks for giving the benefit of the doubt that I&#39;d ever miss a chance to pester you.&quot; She gives you a small peck on the lips to wish you goodnight, [[and the two of you finally get to sleep...-&gt;theMorningAfter]]](noSexBeforeMarriage|[



You each take one side of the room to... prepare.

You use all the strength in your body to avoid looking towards the center of this room.

You doubt Ari would mind, knowing her, but you&#39;ve added so many things to your mental journal today. Not to mention, if you looked, then she&#39;d look, and if Ari saw you like this, she&#39;d probably just decide to face the king alone. You&#39;re at your best when you can use your clothes to give yourself some real curves. Honestly, you were expecting so-

&quot;Uhm... $shortName...? Do you mind if I... maybe... turn around?&quot; Your breathing quickens.

Unfortunately for you, your heart answers the way you really want to, and not the way your mind knows you should.

&quot;Uh... only if you&#39;re sure you want to...&quot; You&#39;ve already started blushing, even though she&#39;s probably reconsidered already. You just-

&quot;W-would you be uncomfortable if I said something...?&quot;

Yes. Yes. Yes. Dear gods, please don&#39;t let her say anything. Don&#39;t talk. There&#39;s no way anything she&#39;d say would do anything but embarrass yo-

&quot;Uh... feel free...&quot; Your heart has mutinied your mind.

&quot;$shortName... you look... absolutely ethereal...&quot;

And like that, your thoughts turns off, and your heart assumes full control.

&quot;Y-you really think so-&quot; You instinctively turn when you respond, and you see... **her**... You immediately move to hide your flushing face.

&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; Ari chuckles as she takes a few tentative steps towards you. You&#39;re still screaming internally. 

You try to process a single moment of sight. Your entire mind fills with a heavy fog. An ache fills your heart, something less of //want// and more of &#39;&#39;need&#39;&#39;.

That single glance replays several times in your head. Your gaze flicks over the paths of scars which run across the width of Ari&#39;s chest. You knew a knight errant would need some serious musculature... but you&#39;d never thought too hard about what that would look like. Now, you can barely think about anything else, at least until Ari reaches you.

Ari meets your gaze, now much closer... extremely close. She motions with her arms, and you accept, wrapping her in your embrace. You rest your head on hers, and all of your fears seem to melt away. Ariadne exploits her height disadvantage to leave a brief, cloying kiss on your collarbone.

When you separate, Ari takes your hands in hers.

&quot;Shall we, princess?&quot; Heat floods your face, and you give Ari a small nod. She guides you to the bed, gently laying you down before circling to lay on the other side.



Once you&#39;ve both settled in, Ariadne turns to you, her face flushed from thought alone.

&quot;Uhm... this bed is pretty stiff, maybe we could-&quot; You cut her off before she can hatch some ridiculous excuse, and you just pull her into your arms. You&#39;re much warmer together than with any of Payla&#39;s cheap blankets, anyway.

You watch over Ari for some time. She dozes quickly in your arms, resting her head on your chest. Once Ari finally seems to be out, you give her a soft goodnight kiss, and, after an unbelievably long day, [[you finally drift off to sleep...-&gt;starsOne]]](OwOWhatsDis|](theVow|</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="theMorningAfter" tags="" position="4000,3300" size="100,100">(if:$catholicism is 1)[You wake up, to your confusion, on Payla&#39;s guest bed.

&quot;Oh, the princess finally rises. Good morning~&quot; Ari gives you a wide grin. She&#39;s already all suited up, watching over you. For once, you&#39;re happy to have a protector.

&quot;You seemed like you were having trouble sleeping, so I let you take the bed...&quot; Your face flushes.

&quot;Uhm. T-thanks...&quot; Ari takes your hand and pulls you from bed.

&quot;Come now, we&#39;ve got places to be, Princess $shortName.&quot; Ari toussles your hair, and you give her a sideways glare.](else:)[You wake, basking in the residual warmth of a rare pleasant dream.

The solar lamps of the waterways stream light through the window of Payla&#39;s guest bedroom. You&#39;re still swaddled in the single, cheap blanket that you and Ari were given to share. Turning your head, you realize you&#39;re resting it in Ariadne&#39;s lap.

Ari tuts at your attempts to flee and continues coiling her fingers through your hair.

&quot;Took you long enough, sleepyhead.&quot; She gives you a warm smile, bending down to kiss your forehead, and you flush at her touch.

&quot;Oh... uhm... how long was I out?&quot; Ari lets out a honeysuckle laugh.

&quot;I&#39;m... not sure, really. When I woke up, it was still dark out. You were shaking a bunch, so I&#39;ve just... uhm... been laying like this...&quot; She seems embarrassed to mention it aloud, but she hasn&#39;t moved you from her. You sit up and shoot Ari a sly grin.

&quot;You&#39;re not just giving me this treatment because I&#39;m a princess, I hope?&quot;

She calls your bluff, and grabs you by the chin.

&quot;And what if I&#39;m doing it because you&#39;re //my// princess?&quot; She starts the motions to kiss you on the lips, but she can&#39;t keep her confidence all the way to you, so she collapses blushing into the bed.

The two of you laze about like this for a while more. You know you have to get on the road... but Ari makes you want to stay put.

It&#39;s during your &quot;Cuddle Until You Have The Energy To Mock Each Other Again&quot; phase that Payla finally opens the door. Of course she wouldn&#39;t knock.

&quot;Good morning $Name! Hope you and yer friend slept well... I presume you&#39;ll be on your way?&quot; You and Ari both silently nod from beneath the lone blanket, and Payla leaves you alone.]&lt;wakingUp|[



The two of you sweep over the room, making sure you&#39;ve grabbed all of your incredibly sparse worldly posessions. (if:$tenderFlower is 1)[Ari has pinned your gifted daisy behind her ear again.] You plan a route with your vague recollections of the Royal Conservatory ahead of you. With any luck, you could reach the capitol without stopping once. In your excitement for real progress, you realize you&#39;ve forgotten a major part of your morning routine.

Apologizing to Ari, you sequester yourself in a corner, producing a simple syringe from your bag. With a grimace, you jab it into your thigh. A few deep breaths, in and out, and the dull throbbing pain fades back into nothing. Ari gives you a concerned look as she approaches.

&quot;You&#39;re not dying on me, are you?&quot; She&#39;s smiling, but she takes your hand as if the slightest touch would turn you to ash.

&quot;I was planning to wait a bit longer on that front. Just for maximum emotional impact, y&#39;know?&quot; Your coyness can&#39;t seem to shake her concern, but she holds you a bit tighter.

Before long, you&#39;ve passed far beyond the lights of the waterways&#39; township, following the water towards the next hurdle on your path.

One small step along the path of the waterways, and the air goes chill around you. You&#39;ve entered an open cavern, flanked by trees and drowned in oppressive shadows. Your trip is mostly silent for the first few miles.

&quot;Oh... uh... that&#39;s not... well...&quot; With one moment of hesitation, your fate has been sealed.

A fiend has noticed you dallying on the path, and she flags down your overcurious companion. This will //certainly// throw off your timetable.



The fiend woman reaches you and drops in a theatrical bow.(if:$tenderFlower is 1)[

You have to admit, you like the flattering epithets.

What kind of royal wedding could it even be without the presence of Darkmoon Demaetria?&quot; She strikes a little pose as she drops her own name. 

At this point, Ari(if:$tenderFlower is 1)[, back in the world of the living,] has caught on to the fiend&#39;s game.

&quot;Okay... fine... What do you want, Demaetria?&quot; You&#39;re ashamed of yourself for getting caught like this. She could be bluffing, but you don&#39;t want to know what Father would do if he&#39;d thought you&#39;d eloped. It&#39;s especially damning, because you&#39;re not even sure if //you&#39;ve// eloped or not. 

&quot;Oh dear, I don&#39;t know what you mean. I might, however know one thing that could mend my broken heart...&quot; You&#39;re not sure if her theatrics make the extortion easier or harder.

&quot;Perhaps... no... it would be too much to ask... but... maybe... The Darkmoon Theater could have Princess $Name, the Divinely Beautiful, show her face in our show tonight?&quot; Demaetria reaches out her hand.

The Darkmoon Theatre is less of a building, and more of a small town. The grounds are littered with housing for performers as well as their wildly overpriced company store. Performers and visitors mill about in all the common spaces. As you&#39;re entering, Ari gives you a small tap on the shoulder.

&quot;You might want to have this on, $shortName.&quot; She hands you your old blobification hood. You hadn&#39;t even considered what might happen if people recognize you with Ari. It&#39;s bad enough having a single thespian threatening to talk to your dad, you&#39;d never survive a dozen.

Once the two of you safely make it into the main tent, you can breathe more easily. Inside, there are reserved royal accomodations. You highly doubt Father will be in the Darkmoon tonight, so you and Ari can at least plan your coerced evening from a soft bed.


Ariadne flops onto the royal mattress in front of you.
&quot;Hey $shortName(print:$shortName&#39;s last)~, I snatched one of these from a rack by the entrance. I&#39;ll let you pick, since //I// never got Abyssal lessons from the Demon King.&quot; With a wink, Ari hands you a flier of showtimes and plot summaries.

&quot;I&#39;ll have you know I learned Abyssal from a //tutor//, thank you very much.&quot; You draw some saccharine laughter from Ari with that, and you can  **feel** your energy returning to you.

You are a bit confused by the practice of writing a flier in Abyssal, but that&#39;s not a problem for you. However, choosing from the packed schedule might be a chore.

&quot;Uh... Demaetria...? Thanks, and all, but what does any of that... well, //mean//?&quot; Your head is already throbbing, but it couldn&#39;t hurt to stuff in some more incomprehensible gibberish from Demaetria. After all, when would she ever waste your time?

&quot;I... your liege... with this seal, your blood shall call to the throne... I can explain more... but... maybe not with your... //friend// in the room?&quot;

...

...

[&quot;Absolutely not.&quot;]&lt;beep|(click:?beep)[==

...

&quot;Very well...&quot; Demaetria stalks towards the door. Her eyes have gone cold. &quot;Just remember... nobody can escape their birthright forever, young prince. See you at your performance tonight...&quot;

Ari&#39;s jaw is entirely slack. You have to restrain her sword hand, an effort that is exacerbated by your rapidly worsening migraine. The top of your head burns, but Ari holds you while you suffer. 

&quot;I... I cannot believe the nerve on that woman... I do wish you&#39;d just let me perform acts of extraordinary violence sometimes, dear...&quot; You tear up a little... either out of pride or from the pain.

&quot;Uhm... do you need food or... anything...?&quot; You imagine you look horrific for her to be so worried.

&quot;Uh... actually food would be nice... as long as you&#39;re eating too.&quot; Your &#39;sweet smile&#39; probably looks closer to the realm of &#39;raised corpse&#39;s grin&#39;, but you doubt Ari minds. As your... uh... traveling companion... seeks out some food for your absolutely crashed date, you feel around your head, expecting some sort of knot near the source of the headache. Maybe some debris fell on you... or...?

You find... well... [[something worse.-&gt;hornTime]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="hornTime" tags="" position="4500,3600" size="100,100">At the top of your head rest two, relatively small, but hard, bumps. Whatever //seal// Demaetria was talking about, its somehow started the regrowth of your horns.

If you were in the core, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. You could just talk to the royal physician, he&#39;d lecture you about getting good rest and avoiding stress to prevent maturation, but inevitably schedule you to have them cut back down. Back then... this wasn&#39;t really an issue, but Duercas is currently thousands of kilometers away... You can&#39;t stop yourself from rubbing at them. They feel foreign, almost infectious, but you&#39;re stuck with them for now.



You hear the doorknob click, and you immediately jump to bury yourself in the royal blankets.

&quot;Hey $shortName-&quot; Ari cuts herself off with a gasp. She walks up towards the bedside, gently laying down next to the formless blob of cloth you&#39;ve made your home.

&quot;Hey $shortName... sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to wake you, if I did... Demaetria gave me some dumplings, said they&#39;d be better for you than anything they sell in the courtyard... I hope you&#39;re feeling better...&quot; Ari places an arm loosely around your blob.

&quot;If you need me to go talk to Demaetria... if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be ready by tonight... just tell me and I can go let her know... no violence, I promise.&quot; Ari is cradling the blob. You finally break out of it and spread the blanket to her.

&quot;I&#39;ll... uh... I&#39;ll be okay for tonight, I think... just a long day...&quot; You put your arm around Ari, and she pulls you into an embrace.

&quot;Yeah... yeah I feel that... Also if... breaking seals... are contagious, you&#39;d better not be giving them to me.&quot; The two of you laugh together for a while. You feel... at peace. Whatever comes next, you feel like you can find a way through. You almost wish your performance //were// delayed, just so you could stay like this... but that gives you a more pressing question.

&quot;Uh... Ari...? What happened to the theatre...?&quot; 

&quot;Oh... uhm... I was a bit busy trying to get you out, but it seemed to be in a bad state... The stagehands put out the fire pretty quickly, but everyone seemed really shaken up...&quot; Ariadne tears up. It seems like an upsetting memory for her.

[&quot;Hey... It&#39;s okay, Ari. I&#39;m safe now.&quot;]&lt;jeck|(click:?jeck)[== You place a little kiss on your savior&#39;s cheek, and she returns it on your forehead. 

&quot;You know, I&#39;m sort of glad we&#39;re still doing the show. I think it&#39;ll be a fun little diversion from all this... Oh, you&#39;ll also be delighted to know that Demaetria gave me the lines for our roles, so we can practice~, if you feel up to it.&quot; Ariadne hands you a few loose sheets of paper. 

It&#39;s about as bad as you expected. Demaetria gave you a stupidly easy play, just so you coudn&#39;t possibly mess it up. You even performed the exact same play in your acting classes as a child. You don&#39;t exactly //want// Demaetria to have more faith in you, what with the blackmail, but it does hurt your pride.

&quot;Oooh, you&#39;re to be my valiant knight. What a change of pace~&quot; Ari grins at you, and you try to smile back, despite your dissapointment. You&#39;ve been in this play five times, you&#39;ve been the knight four times, and a tree once. Surprisingly, the tree was a much better performance for you.



The two of you attempt some staged readings of your lines. Mainly //you// do, as Ari doesn&#39;t get many lines as the princess. It&#39;s not long before you have to take a break. You tell Ariadne that your head is acting up, and it certainly is, just... not because of your sickness. Ari holds you while you rest, going over your script so she can wrap her head around the plot. 

You wouldn&#39;t admit it to her, but the way Ari has progressed from playing with //her// hair when nervous to playing with //yours// makes you feel... warm... or... at home... or something... Even if you&#39;d like to admit it, you&#39;re not totally sure how you&#39;d describe the feeling. All you know is that you don&#39;t want it to stop. 

You&#39;re not sure why reading through your lines would have Ari like this. Maybe she&#39;s nervous for you to kiss her hand in front of so many people. That&#39;s probably a much bigger deal to humans. You don&#39;t mind, though, and the two of you stay like this for some time, Ari reading intently, and you cuddling up to keep her comfortable.

[[After some time, you fall asleep on Ari&#39;s shoulder-&gt;thePlay]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="thePlay" tags="" position="4600,3600" size="100,100">You awaken, still wrapped in Ariadne&#39;s arms. Both of your scripts are lain out in front of you. Ari gives you a peck on the cheek.

&quot;Well good morning, oh Princess $shortName. I do hope you have received some rest on this fine morn.&quot; Ari&#39;s mocking servant voice shouldn&#39;t be as funny as it is, but it always makes you laugh somehow.

&quot;Oh... also Demaetria said we need to get backstage soon. Just so you know.&quot;

Ari is already prepared, but you spend a short while looking over yourself. It&#39;s not easy to style your hair in a way that hides your horns but still looks nice. You could easily get one of the backstage professionals to help, but you&#39;d rather keep the crew away from your new twin headaches. As you preen, you catch glimpses of Ari, lying on the bed and shamelessly marveling at you. You blow a kiss her way, and she nearly collapses.

Now, more presentable, the two of you finally head backstage. There, dozens of staff members flock to Ariadne&#39;s side, primping their princess to be flawless for the stage. Rather than staff, you simply have Demaetria, waiting for you.

&quot;Princess $Name, you&#39;ve finally arrived. I&#39;m glad.&quot; She seems a lot less showey now, and her eyes look sunken. You&#39;ve never Demaetria like this. 

&quot;I&#39;ve prepared your armor. I never got time to find out your... ahem... proportions, so I&#39;ve set you up with heavy plate. It&#39;ll be a little loose, but you should be able to adjust it as needed. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re in any actual danger.&quot; She clearly tries to laugh, but it breaks into hacking coughs.

&quot;Uh... Demaetria...? Are you... doing okay?&quot; You&#39;d feel rude if you didn&#39;t //at least// ask.

&quot;Child... I will be fine. I simply need rest, since... well... ahem... don&#39;t concern yourself with me. Try to enjoy the show.&quot; Demaetria gives a weak snap and collapses into shadows. You&#39;re a little offput, but you doubt she&#39;d ever lead you //too// astray. She&#39;s probably just tired. Your mind is more busy thinking about the play anyway. A stagehand wheels in your armor and it looks... shiny? Nice? You don&#39;t really know what you&#39;d want in armor. It&#39;s never been your style. You catch a glimpse of Ari beneath her cloud of attendants, and she looks... distressed.

&quot;Hey... can you people leave her alone? She looks fine...&quot; You doubt the stagehands will even listen to you, but they all bow and head off. Sometimes royalty has its perks.

&quot;You look absolutely lost, Ariadne...&quot; She&#39;s looking in horror at the mirror, touching parts of her face and watching the makeup cake off. It was clearly made someone with a far more Abyssal complexion, so it looks like ashy warpaint on her. Beside you, a stagehand wheels in Ari&#39;s outfit, a shimmering, floor-length black dress, complete with a tiara pulled straight from some storybook, and a tall pair of heels, likely to bring Ari nearer to your height. It&#39;s cheesy, but it&#39;s still cute.

&quot;I just... how do you ever deal with this, $shortName...? This is horrific.&quot; She&#39;s started removing all of her assistants&#39; work.

&quot;Oh I... uh... usually don&#39;t... They don&#39;t make much stuff in my... well... shade. I... I&#39;ve gotten used to it.&quot; Ari, slowly returning to her normal self, approaches you, taking your face in her hand.

&quot;Well... who needs it? I think you look //just// fine without it.&quot; She hovers over you for a bit, but leaves you with only a wink.

You slump over your vanity. Holding your face in your hands, you close your eyes and try to prepare yourself emotionally. The general racket behind you fades out, and you focus on your breathing. You&#39;ve gone through plenty of this before. Just an hour or so of suffering, and it&#39;s over. You never even have to come back to the theatre.

You&#39;re roused by Ariadne&#39;s voice. 

&quot;Oh, and $shortName...? Be careful not to trip, dear~&quot;

And, before you even notice it happening, the curtains rise, and [[Ariadne walks onstage in your armor.-&gt;thePlayBegins]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="thePlayBegins" tags="" position="4700,3600" size="100,100">You&#39;ve read over the script Ariadne left you dozens of times. As a princess in a story written by people your dad&#39;s age, you only really come in near the end, when the knight needs a prize for his hard work.

You&#39;ve never been more thankful to have your royal clout. Ari&#39;s stagehands are an absolute treasure for you, teaching you where to enter, when to say your lines, and updating you on how Ari is doing. They tell you that she&#39;s doing an amazing job, giving all sorts of praise for her delivery and stage presence. You only wish you could be in the crowd to watch her. 

Two acts full of worrying and fretting later, you finally get in position. You take a deep breath as a small section of curtain [slides up.]&lt;curtainCall|(click:?curtainCall)[==

You step out to finally meet the packed crowd. There are nearly no empty seats. You don&#39;t know why so many people would show up to such a boring play, but your thoughts are cut off by the crowd cheering... Most likely out of obligation. 

From your wooden tower, your eye catches another at the back of the theatre. Demaetria is watching you. You give her a small smile and turn back to the stage. Your script commands you very directly to, &quot;Stand in place and look lovely&quot;, so you have plenty of time to watch Ariadne at work.

Ari seems much more at home with a sword in hand. As she explains her clever ruse to the nefarious human horde (all played by fiends, obviously) your mind begins to wander.

You worry what the crowd might be thinking. Ariadne looks majestic, but you feel like your costume //just// doesn&#39;t fit right. 

As she woos your character with a soliloquoy you&#39;ve told many times yourself, you imagine that, somewhere in the crowd, there&#39;s a confused child, loudly asking his mother, &quot;Mummy, why is the princess being played by a man in a dress?&quot; 

[You slowly descend a ramp from your starting position.]&lt;ramp|(click:?ramp)[== You assume that this child&#39;s mother would chide back, &quot;Now now, Acheron! We aren&#39;t allowed to criticize this due to &#39;Political Correctness.&quot;

[You extend your hand]&lt;hand|(click:?hand)[==, that Ari might kiss it and finally end this misery. You question how people might speak of this embarrassment back at the capitol, and you wonder if they&#39;ll go with &#39;Gangly Beast&#39; or &#39;Disgusting Perversion&#39; more often in their tales.

Ariadne removes her helmet, and your breathing is now troubled both by your nerves and her beauty. You wonder if Demaetria will have to label the play a comedy afterwards, once everyone finally externalizes the laughter they&#39;ve kept inside this entire time.

Ari takes your hand in hers, and, before you can react, her lips are on yours. She pulls away, turning to the crowd to bow, keeping her hand around your own. 

You give a weak curtsy and the crowd... goes absolutely wild, clapping and cheering. The stage is littered with flowers, strangely including an Apollonian Daisy. While you&#39;re still in shock, both from the crowd&#39;s reaction and the idea of throwing such an expensive flower to a performer, Ari takes it from the stage, pinning it behind your ear with a kiss on your cheek.

You have to speed your retreat backstage to avoid publicly weeping.

[[Even once you&#39;ve returned to sit at your vanity in disbelief, the applause continues. -&gt;itsSoFuckingGay]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="itsSoFuckingGay" tags="" position="4800,3600" size="100,100">After Ariadne returns to her vanity, the two of you sit in silence for some time. Your eyes keep darting to the mirror. You... like the tiara and daisy look. You feel uncharacteristically pretty, even if you wouldn&#39;t wear it in public. You decide to finally break the silence.

&quot;So Ari-&quot; Ariadne cuts you off, jumping in your direction before prostrating herself.

&quot;OhMyGod(print:$Name)IAmSoSorryIShouldHaveSaidSomethingYouCanExecuteMeHereTakeMySwor-&quot; You lift Ari&#39;s face with your thumb so you can look into her eyes.


You silence Ariadne by occupying her mouth with ~other tasks~.


...


You take your time with this one. You were a bit upset at how brief Ari had to be before.


...


You pull away, and Ariadne collapses to the floor in a haze.

&quot;So... I believe that we&#39;re even now, A~ri~ad~ne~.&quot; Ari&#39;s blush seems to go straight through her hands.

Demaetria shoots you a look from the back of the room, [but you only smile at her]&lt;haGetFucked|.(click:?haGetFucked)[==



Once Ari finally recovers, the two of you stop by the royal accomodations to get some rest. Demaetria never comes by to see you, but you&#39;ve seemingly fulfilled your obligation, even if it set you back a day. Ariadne looks troubled as she lays waiting. You drop down beside her.

&quot;Long day, huh, Ari?&quot; You place a supportive hand on her back, and she gives you a pained look before pulling you into an embrace.

&quot;I&#39;m... uhm... I&#39;m sorry, $shortName... I shouldn&#39;t have dropped all of that on you without warning...&quot; She sounds seriously choked up.

&quot;Ari... It&#39;s okay. Your little stunt was... brave...&quot; She pulls back to look into your eyes.

&quot;I... no... no, it wasn&#39;t okay of me, $Name... We... we shouldn&#39;t keep stuff like this secret from each other, if we&#39;re going to be... uhm... y&#39;know...&quot;

...

&quot;B-besides...! Wouldn&#39;t it have been even more fun to go on this little caper together? Surprises are fun... but... if you had been uncomfortable with it, that would have been awful of me...! Trust is important in... uhm... you know...&quot; Ari&#39;s gaze falls.

&quot;Uh... y-yeah... I guess you&#39;re right. But... even still... I&#39;m glad you did it... I... uhm... I had fun.&quot; You&#39;ve started blushing enough for Ari to go on the offensive.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it, oh Princess $Name... and I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t catch on to my //other// secret scheme. I just really wanted to see you in heels.&quot; You laugh into Ari&#39;s shoulder. She takes the daisy from behind your ear and places it with her own on your bedside table. Ariadne pulls you back and presses her lips to yours, briefly.

&quot;Now let&#39;s get some rest, dear. I&#39;m not the expert, but I ~doubt~ your dad and brother will let us win just on account of your cuteness and my dashing charm.&quot;

&quot;Uh... y-yeah... goodnight...&quot; Ariadne has already slipped into unconsciousness.


...


...


You, on the other hand, can&#39;t seem to find peace.


...


...


You just hold Ari and lie with her, your eyes barely ever closing.


...

[[There&#39;s just too much running through your head.

Ari goes over your entire body, sometimes apologizing profusely, but resolute. She finds no injuries on you.

&quot;I... okay... I&#39;m glad.&quot; Tears are welling up in her eyes.

&quot;I was just afraid... maybe you-&quot; You cut her off with an embrace. You hold one another for some time, and her fears seem to dissolve.

&quot;Okay... I&#39;ll just trust that whoever that belongs to deserved it.&quot; She gives you a sly smile... you struggle to return her confidence. (show:?itsADeparture)](silent| [

&quot;$shortName... I... I&#39;m not hurt... you&#39;re not either, right?&quot;

Ari wraps her arms around you, burying her face in your neck.
&quot;$shortName... I&#39;m... afraid...&quot;

You just hold onto her. You are too. (show:?itsADeparture)](afraid| [
&quot;I... oh... oh $shortName, sweetheart... I&#39;m okay...&quot; Ari quickly checks over everywhere she had exposed. No marks of any kind.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, dear. You didn&#39;t hurt me.&quot; She gives you a soft smile. You struggle to return it. You&#39;re far more afraid of the alternative to an accidental scratching. (show:?itsADeparture)](concerned|[

The two of you complete the rest of your departure silently. Ari dons her armor, you hold her hand when you take your medicine, all the while you can&#39;t stop thinking about that blood, or about last night, or about what Demaetria told you. There&#39;s a dark patch in your memory. Your thoughts race as you step out into the darkness.

Once you&#39;ve finally returned to the split road where this all began, you look back. Watching over you is Demaetria. Her right eye is shut, and the right side of her face, from her forehead to her chin, is covered in dark, red scars.

The road along the Royal Conservatory is quiet.
Despite the groves of trees that surround you, the entire place seems to fight any form of life.

You don&#39;t speak much. You&#39;ve got too much to think about. Ari holds your hand to make sure you&#39;re close, but she doesn&#39;t speak much either.

When you trip while descending a deep drop, Ari catches you. She makes her usual &quot;about to make an awful joke&quot; smile... but she goes silent.

Content Warnings for:

[Depiction of Sexual Harassment]&lt;warningHar| [(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
---
	A minor antagonist rather early on makes some uncomfortable remarks about the PC&#39;s body, which are easily within the realm of sexual harassment. The deuteragonist responds with hostility to these remarks, defending the PC in her stead, up to and including violent retribution, if you allow her.[

	Yugeniose&#39;s remarks are specifically harassment directly linked to the PC&#39;s transition, which felt like a relevant thing to include here. None of it is too intense, and it&#39;s grounded in personal experiences. I also felt it important to establish early that the cis deuteragonist wouldn&#39;t be ignorant to these sorts of aggressions. This isn&#39;t a story about a cis person learning to navigate trans issues, it&#39;s //about// the most aggressive sapphism possible.

	A snake demon named Yugeniose approaches the PC near the end of chapter 1. Off of her reaction, it is clear that he has regularly made the PC uncomfortable. He comments on her body&#39;s changes, which are implied to be due to hormones. The deuteragonist tells him to respect the PC, and she threatens him. He scurries off and, if you choose, the deuteragonist will //just// kill him. Yugeniose is given no sympathy at any point.

---
	This one is pretty significant. If I were to say this story were //about// some things, abuse would be one of them. A large portion of the plot is dedicated to the PC&#39;s relationship with her abusive father. This is mostly revealed in retrospective, as the PC&#39;s father is not present until the end of the story. A portion of the story takes place within the PC&#39;s past, and it prominently features more explicit abuse.
	There is additionally one more character who, while not related to the PC, acts as a similar figure of abuse. This figure //is// directly present, but they are a much less significant source of conflict for the PC.
	Also, lots of the PC&#39;s internal monologue **is** abusive towards herself, as are some things the deuteragonist says to the PC when they fight. The deuteragonist apologizes for these later, realizing she&#39;d hurt the PC because she didn&#39;t know the full context for things that were said.[

	This issue sort of arises from me telling a story about transness containing my own history and anxieties. Obviously, my goal was mostly set on fluffy trans lesbian love, but the abuse narrative slowly crept its way in, so I decided to give it the respect it deserved. As such, the plot twisted into, essentially, a story about overcoming trauma related to abuse. I stand by that choice, and I hope I&#39;ve made it compelling.
]](whyAbu|[(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	
	The PC&#39;s father, Orion, doesn&#39;t respect her gender identity. This isn&#39;t super explicit at first, but it becomes more apparent over time. Additionally present is a significant case of Orion gaslighting the PC over the loss of two of her dear friends. Orion is shown to have very specific wants out of the PC, and he responds with anger when those wants aren&#39;t met. Over time, this abuse takes center stage as the PC builds up her self worth and prepares to face off against him.
	Additionally, in Chapter Four, the character of Demaetria appears. She manipulates the PC from the beginning, but, once a cosmic event sets major plot in motion, she becomes much more overt, begging the PC to go and fulfill her father&#39;s goals for her, later even mocking the PC&#39;s gender performance in a moment where she is incredibly vulnerable.
	In chapter 5, the deuteragonist says awful things to the PC after she admits her role in the tragedy of the deuteragonist&#39;s past. When the two make up, the deuteragonist apologizes, and they work through their shared pain together, which becomes the focus of the third act.

[Depictions of Violence Between Romantic Partners]&lt;warningDom| [(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
---
	There is a //minor// instance of violence between the leads before they&#39;re exactly //partners//, but the two main instances of this comes in the second and third acts, when their relationship is pushed to its limits by their past together and by the PC&#39;s birthright.
	The deuteragonist makes a superficial wound on the PC in an attempt to keep her away, but there is a much more severe scene in the area ahead.
	The scene containing this is entirely optional, only occurring if the player purchases a sword and takes a specific path later on. The violence in the scene is also entirely one-sided, and all damage done to the PC is relatively superficial. It is made thoroughly clear that neither lead actually wants to hurt the other, and that the appearance of that is a projection.
	The similar scene in Act 3 is not optional, and it follows a similar format in the reverse[
	Why?]&lt;whyCDom| [
	Spoilers]&lt;spoilCDom|
	]](whatDom| [(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	In both cases of the leads fighting, the aggressor isn&#39;t fully in control:
	In Act 2, Ariadne has been absorbed by her grief and pain, and she lashes out because she can&#39;t cope with the pain she&#39;s been reminded of.
	In Act 3, the PC has lost control due to plot-related reasons, and she attempts to fight against her own actions.
	]](whyDom|[(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	
	Before truly being together, Ariadne threatens the PC with a sword, but immediately falls apart due to her nervousness. The PC also has the option to hit her with a rock, but she immediately realizes that, even for an enemy, this type of violence is not something she&#39;s capable of carrying on with.
	Later on, Ariadne makes two small cuts on the PC&#39;s cheeks to discourage the PC from following when she leaves.
	In the optional scene with the fight, Ariadne demands that the PC fight her to the death, saying that only one of the two may leave. This is shown to be patently untrue, as she immediately falters any time she lands a hit, and constantly has to beg the PC to actually fight back. There is no path in which the PC actually attacks Ariadne, and the fight will always end with the PC comforting Ari as she weeps over her failure to complete her quest for revenge and the PC telling the full story of her life, at which point Ari apologizes and calms down.
	In the Act 3 fight scene, the PC is trapped in her body as it fights on its own against Ariadne. She stresses against it, but Ariadne refuses to fight back, and the PC regains control of herself before the fight ends badly.

[Depictions of Misgendering]&lt;warningGen| [(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
---
	This one comes with the territory of a game about transphobic abuse. The PC is misgendered often by her two main abusers, often as part of lauding her &quot;destiny&quot; which she is &quot;betraying&quot; by living authentically. The PC also sometimes misgenders herself in her own thoughts, but this is only when she is specifically struggling with anxieties about how people perceive her.
	Act 3 also features a minor character who is trans, and who is repeatedly misgendered by the main antagonist.
	Additionally, neither character is ever deadnamed. Neither of them have written deadnames, and plot convolution has led to the PC&#39;s deadname literally being censored out in flashbacks.[

	Misgendering //is// just a common part of transphobic abuse, but I also wanted to show it in more subtle ways. There&#39;s a reason that no character ever just yells &quot;NYEH YOU&#39;RE A MAN&quot;, because that isn&#39;t how misgendering usually happens. The more insidious types of misgendering I wanted to represent often seem to come from places of genuine care (towards a person who never really existed), thus the association of the PC &quot;abandoning her destiny.&quot; This becomes more aggressive as the plot progresses, specifically with the main antagonist, who repeatedly and callously misgenders the PC.
	]](whyGen|[(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	
	The PC&#39;s father misgenders her in most interactions, both in the past and present. The PC is also misgendered by Demaetria, who similarly believes that her destiny is tied to maleness, and wants to force the PC to pursue this destiny. The majority of these instances come with characters calling the PC a &quot;prince&quot;, or calling the other trans character to face this a &quot;wife&quot;, as well as using incorrect pronouns for both.

]](whyAnx|[(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	
	In chapters 1 and 2, the deuteragonist breaks down under the pressure of her quest or from a near death experience. Both times, the PC tries her best to offer support and help her calm down.
	In chapter 3, the protagonist has an attack of sorts, out of fear that a plot revelation will lead the deuteragonist to hate her, leave, or even kill her. It doesn&#39;t, and the deuteragonist comforts and reassures her.
	Also in chapter 3, the deuteragonist lays her tragic history bare to the PC, during which she has a similar attack to before, at which point the PC stops her and comforts her until she feels ready to continue.
	In chapter 4, the PC has a minor episode, imagining all the things a crowd of people might think about her, preparing for a life of embarrassment and blaming herself for even trying to do anything different. This turns out to be false, as the crowd adores her and throws flowers at her after her performance.
	In chapter 5, the leads get into a fight, and the PC has a pseudo-anxious episode as the deuteragonist storms off. She is able to overcome this, refusing to give in to her internal desires to give up on her quest.
	After Act 2, there are sparse examples of these. Both leads are far more capable at coping in these parts, and, considering the circumstances, their worry is much more warranted.

[Descriptions of Gender Dysphoria]&lt;warningDys| [(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[

	This one is pretty major and vivid. The PC&#39;s dysphoria is deeply tied to many plot threads. Most of the PC&#39;s fears in her internal monologue end up being baseless, and everyone besides her abusers love and support her. 
	Additionally, Act Three is triggered by a large change to the PC&#39;s appearance. At the time, she is far too busy to think that much about her dysphoria, and, by the time things calm down, the deuteragonist is there to aggresively love and support her, despite her changes.[

]](whyDys|[(t8n:&quot;slide-right&quot;)+(t8n-time: 0.4s)[
	
	In chapter 3, there is a scene where the PC is undressed around the deuteragonist for the first time, and she worries that she&#39;ll be judged and reviled. She isn&#39;t, obviously.
	In chapter 4, the PC wears a dress and heels on stage, and her thoughts veer to the awful things they might be thinking about her, except, in reality, they love her and shower her in flowers after her performance.
	In chapter 5, the PC has a protracted dysphoric episode after a... hiccup... in her relationship. This is mostly her own thoughts parroting things her abusers have said, but she refuses to give in and fights them away.
	In chapter 8, the PC undergoes massive physical changes which she compares to a sort of third puberty, and not a particularly enjoyable one. She gains height, muscle mass, and several other features, but she mostly ignores these when she has to focus on far more pressing issues. Near the end of the chapter, the deuteragonist expresses loving affirmation of these features. In one option, the PC jokes about her first puberty in reference to these features, and the deuteragonist apologizes profusely, afraid that her comments were insensitive.
	In chapter 9, some allusions are made to the PC&#39;s bottom dysphoria, and the deuteragonist stops for a moment to express pride and love for the PC working through it. This chapter also features the PC having a full dysphoric breakdown in a bathroom. This plays out similarly to what happens in chapter 5, but in a much safer environment for our lead.
	After this point, the PC is showered with gender euphoria and affirmation, even amongst taunting from her abuser.

You take one look towards her body, [[and you collapse. -&gt;boxOfCorpses]]

With your first tentative step into the clearing, your eyes shoot to back corner, where you see Ari, motionless against a rock, surrounded by cloaked assailants.

In the next moment, one of these assailants lets out a war cry as he drops the blade of his axe directly onto your head. The blade catches on your horn, and [the world loses all color.]&lt;shieldRage|.(click:?shieldRage)[==

You swing your leg out, dropping your attacker to the ground before he can react. You plant a radiant boot on his neck.

The rest of his allies spring into action.

A figure armed with caesti charges you. The group&#39;s archer fires an opening shot at you, which embeds itself in your armor. You free it, and place it a few milimetres from your nearest foe&#39;s lungs.

You approach the archer. He drops his weapon for you. You hoist him by his offered hands, and drop him over a rock.

You check on the lone remaining fighter. He has moved to the corner, where he holds a dagger to Ariadne&#39;s neck. He is trembling. Your eyes meet.

&quot;Now... now listen... are you here for her? Well... t-too bad... You&#39;ll only get her if... if I get out safely.&quot;

The man begins to weep. You extend your glowing hand. Your armor begins to fade, wrapping its light around your outstretched fingers. The assailant&#39;s mouth curls into a grin. In one final attempt at defiance, he launches his dagger at you. It sticks into your shoulder, but you do not move.

His countenance is filled with panic, then a beam of light, and then ceases to exist.

You look at Ari&#39;s form. She&#39;s is totally still. Your vision flickers back into its usual lightness. You fall to your knees, tears welling in your eyes, and you [[lose consciousness-&gt;boxOfCorpses]].

[
You step into the clearing, your eyes immediately scan the space in front of you. In the back, Ari is laying against a rock, her greatsword by her side. To your right there&#39;s a hooded man wielding an axe. In front of you, there are three more hooded figures, one with a bow, one with caesti, and another with a dagger.

You breathe in, face the axe-wielder, and [color fades from the world]&lt;steelRage|.(click:?steelRage)[==

Your assailant&#39;s face contorts to a grin. He takes a single step towards you, and a cloud of abyssal dark flies from your feet, enveloping him entirely. 

The remaining attackers turn to face you. The archer fires a single shot towards you. You place your hand up, and the arrow stops, dark tendrils grab hold of it, and it fires back at its source.

[You snap]&lt;steelFury|(click:?steelFury)[==, and rise from the shadows behind the Caesti wielding rogue. You gently take his head in your hands, and then rotate towards the last remaining foe, who has started cowering against a wall of trees.

The man begins to weep.
&quot;N-no! No she&#39;ll be fine! Just... please... don&#39;t-&quot;

You raise the man above your head, and drop him onto a nearby patch of rocks.

You approach Ari... She isn&#39;t moving. You watch her and feel... tears... rolling down your cheeks. The dark cloud over your vision slowly rises... and [[you collapse to the ground. -&gt;boxOfCorpses]]

You charge into the clearing. Your fears are confirmed. In the corner, Ari is slumped against a rock, motionless, and surrounded by masked attackers. [Your vision goes grey]&lt;roarRage|.(click:?roarRage)[==

Behind you, another assailant grabs you, armed with caesti. You take hold of his arm and squeeze until you hear a crack, before flinging the man to the ground behind you.

The lone remaining bandit calls to you. He has a dagger to Ari&#39;s throat.

&quot;H-hey... no movement... don&#39;t try anything or... or she&#39;s dead...&quot; Tears are streaming down the man&#39;s face.

He drops Ariadne on the ground. You leap onto him. When you stand back up, he is barely recognizable as a once-living being.

You look to Ariadne... she isn&#39;t moving... you drop to your knees. You place a single, bloody hand upon her cheek. Your claws wrap around her face. Your breathing falters.

From a small hole in the path&#39;s wooded edges, you hear a familiar voice calling out.

&quot;Please... anybody... help me...&quot;

Your heartrate rises. You... you didn&#39;t think you&#39;d find her so easily... You burst into the small cut in the wall. You run through looping tunnels, ignoring the world around you.

You can hear her so closely now... You&#39;ve nearly got her... you reach the end of the tunnel and...

You turn around, and see that the walls have closed in on you. You&#39;re... trapped...





You feel something wrap around your chin.
&quot;Oh... $shortName... You never were the brightest... I&#39;m glad I finally left you behind...&quot; 

You spin around and see that a branch has wrapped itself around your face. You still hear her behind you.
&quot;Pitiful little $Name... she thought she could save the one she loved... how typical...&quot;
A root wraps around your foot.

&quot;Such a shame she&#39;s a failure... She&#39;s so blind for her //dear// Ariadne that she&#39;d fall for anything...&quot; 
A vine restricts your arm. [You pull against it, but it won&#39;t budge.]&lt;heck|(click:?heck)[==

&quot;So this is how her story ends... poor little princess... She never even got to use these...&quot;
A branch wraps around your horns.

Breathing becomes nearly impossible. You look down and see vines wrapping around your neck.

Every muscle in your body screams at you to sleep longer, but your eyes follow your mind and rouse from their slumber. You&#39;re propped against a rock, laying on the forest floor.
You have to readjust to see in the dim light of the conservatory.

In the distance, another form comes into focus.
On the opposite end of the clearing, Ariadne sits. Her sword is stuck into the ground. She&#39;s tending a small fire with a pot over it. 
You call out to her.

&quot;A-Ari...?&quot;
Speaking is incredibly painful, but you seem to have her attention.

Ariadne walks over to you with a cup of yellow fluid.
&quot;Come on... drink up... If I have to keep living, you do too, princess...&quot;

She presses a cup of warm broth to your lips. It&#39;s... not to your palate... but it warms you up, and your muscles feel less prepared to mutiny against you.

The two of you sit in silence for some time.



Ariadne speaks first.
&quot;You know... I was pretty clear about the whole &#39;Don&#39;t follow me or I&#39;ll kill you&#39; thing... You&#39;re either not as smart as I thought, or... I guess //rightfully//... concerned...&quot;
She can&#39;t meet your gaze.

&quot;I... I was scared, Ari...&quot;
Ariadne seems taken aback. She turns away and stands.

&quot;Well... no need to be afraid now... Goodbye... $Name...&quot;
You lurch forward, calling out to her.

&quot;A-Ari... //please//...&quot;
Ariadne stops and hangs her head. You can see tears dropping from her cheeks.

&quot;I said... goodbye...  Euphie wouldn&#39;t want me to stick around here...&quot;
She moves towards the exit of the clearing. You have an uncharacteristic burst of stamina. You attempt to follow after her, but you crash back to the dirt.

&quot;Ariadne... I&#39;ve already lost you twice... please... stay...&quot;
Your own tears begin to wet the dirt beneath you. Ariadne stops in her tracks. 

You lay in a heap on the forest floor for some time, until...

&quot;$Name... what do you mean **&#39;twice&#39;**...?&quot;
Ari rolls you over, wiping dirt from your hair. You... suppose you never told her that much...

&quot;I... well... can you promise you&#39;ll stay and let me tell the full story...?&quot;
Ari looks... intrigued. She balances her head on her knees and looks away from you.

&quot;I... sure... start from the very beginning... after that... no promises...&quot;

You give Ari a short smile.

You slowly get your bearings and realize... you&#39;re being carried.

She lays you down against a flat rock, sitting herself on the opposite side of it, where she has a few last violent coughs.

The two of you sit for some time in silence.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine... I&#39;m probably in more danger being around you anyway...&quot; She takes another step before collapsing into a heap. You run to her side.

&quot;Ari! Ari, //please//... your body clearly can&#39;t take this... please just stay...&quot; You place a hand on Ariadne&#39;s shoulder, and she shoves you to the ground, pulling herself into a standing position again.

Not again... You can&#39;t go through this &#39;&#39;again&#39;&#39;...


You reach towards Ariadne&#39;s shadow.

King Orion has held the throne in The Abyss for twenty-seven years.
An unknown consort gives birth to a son, whose name has been expunged from history.
The child is healthy. He is enamored with learning, and Orion spares no expense in his tutelage. He is to be raised as Orion&#39;s successor.

Orion finally relents and agrees to meet the child&#39;s human friends the next day.

Orion is silent for the remainder of the night.

It is nine years, nine months, and nine days before the current day.

//**There are zero days until The Anomaly.**//

The child meets with his friends, telling them the good news.
In a clearing between the maw and the village, the trio play games and wait. Some time passes, with no sign of Orion. The child goes to seek his father out.

The child runs through the forest tearfully, upset that his father would go back on a promise. The child searches all the way to the maw, but there is no sign of the king.
The child returns, prepared to give the bad news, but, on the way, he runs into Orion.
The king comforts the child. Wiping his tears, he tells of the human children&#39;s planned betrayal. Orion warns that the humans were laying a trap for the child.
The child cannot believe Orion&#39;s story. He runs to the clearing where his friends were. In their place, a mob is armed with swords and torches.

It is five years and seven months before the current day.
The royal guard has, on multiple occasions, found the child hiding out in a run-down sewer. The guards cannot ascertain their doing.

It is four years and six months before the current day.
The child makes regular trips to the now unveiled Abyssal Waterways.

Orion refuses, out of fear the child will make good on her threat.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe the Demon King&#39;s daughter is such a massive dork...&quot; Ariadne bends down, cradling your head as she attacks with darting kisses. Your laughter spills out, and you respond with your own flurry of affection. You wrap your arms around Ari, and she drops down to lay with you. 



The Royal Conservatory is perpetually cold, hostile, and dark, but... in Ari&#39;s arms... [[it feels like home... -&gt;movingOnTogether]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="movingOnTogether" tags="" position="4300,4200" size="100,100">
&lt;h2&gt;-3100 km: What Remains of Detritus and Omens&lt;/h2&gt;

Near the end of the Royal Conservatory, the paths become more rigid, and the road is dotted with provisional townships. As you near the Abyssal Capitol, guard patrols rapidly increase. You and Ariadne cover up more. You&#39;re not sure what might happen, but you don&#39;t want to be recognized. You&#39;re approaching the enduring village of Scindos when Ari pulls you aside and into a hidden clearing.

&quot;Hey, uh, $shortName... can we talk..? Nothing too heavy, I promise.&quot; Ari squeezes your hand disarmingly to accompany her reassurance.

&quot;How convenient that there&#39;s always a safe grotto when you want to have an emotional conversation, love... But obviously we can talk...&quot; Ari suppresses her laughter by glaring at you. It&#39;s a trick that would work better if her eyes didn&#39;t light up every time she wanted to laugh.

&quot;It&#39;s just... I didn&#39;t want us to get into another life or death situation before I could apologize... I wouldn&#39;t want us going into danger with anything but the utmost trust.&quot; 
You&#39;re a bit offput by Ari&#39;s insistence that the two of you will risk your lives soon, but you guide her to a wide stone, where the two of you sit together.

&quot;Hey, hey... It&#39;s gonna be okay... I have no intentions of leaving you behind. If we get captured, I&#39;m getting us a shared prison cell.&quot; You smirk at Ari and she laughs.

&quot;Is... is that something you can do?&quot; She seems genuinely intrigued at the idea.

&quot;I... y&#39;know, I haven&#39;t tried. Hopefully I won&#39;t have to, though... but, just in case, I give you royal permission to get emotional now, dear...&quot; You drop your head in a mocking bow. You and Ari pause for a few minutes while your laughter dies down.

&quot;R-right, thank you...&quot; Ari looks worried. You squeeze her hand to reassure her.

&quot;Ari~ Ari~ Ari~.&quot; You tut at her. While Ariadne is distracted by being sheepish, you wrap an arm around her and pull her in close.
&quot;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re still under lots of stress, and you had a bad reaction to some shocking news. You didn&#39;t have the full story, so I won&#39;t hold it against you.&quot; Ari is tearing up, so you put her head on your shoulder.

&quot;Y-you&#39;re sure...? I... even for the circumstances... that... wasn&#39;t okay of me...&quot; Ari meets your eyes from your shoulder. You place a tiny kiss on her forehead.

&quot;I promise. What you said may have been bad, but the reactions you have when vulnerable don&#39;t define you... The real Ari... //my// real Ari... she&#39;s more apt to care too much, rather than not enough.&quot; You wipe a tear from Ariadne&#39;s cheek and she buries her face in your neck.

&quot;I... okay... th-thank you... I feel better now, $shortName... I... uhm... I love you...&quot; Ari&#39;s voice gets really small when she says that. You&#39;re not sure why, but you adore it.

&quot;And I love you, too. How long do you need &#39;til we head back out?&quot; You idly stroke Ari&#39;s hair as she clings to you.

&quot;I wish it could be longer... ... ... Maybe just five more minutes?&quot; You laugh, and Ari&#39;s five minutes end up as twenty-five. You don&#39;t mind. [[You&#39;ve got plenty of time, here-&gt;enterScindos]].

You&#39;ve never even seen //a// guard in this town, but the entire front half of the town seems to be crawling with royal guardsmen.

You silently make your way across town, sneaking from alley to alley, sometimes waiting for miniscule holes in patrol routes. There&#39;s one place in Scindos you //know// will be safe. Clearly, getting into the capitol will be harder than expected, so you need somewhere to regroup and rest. You&#39;d hoped to make it through while the towns were still awake, but, with the new guard presence, you&#39;re not even sure if the front gates will be an option anymore.

You and Ari take a moment to breathe while you&#39;re hidden behind a winery.

&quot;So... uhm... I assume this place isn&#39;t always riddled with tall spooky dudes in gold-tinted armor... any idea what&#39;s going on, $shortName?&quot; 

&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure... I don&#39;t think Dad&#39;s ever been this antsy about me missing dinner before...&quot; Ari has to stifle a laugh.

&quot;I think you&#39;ve missed more than a few dinners, love... but it seems weird that it would only be now... I... just get a bad feeling from this... I don&#39;t want to walk in-&quot; You throw your hand over Ari&#39;s mouth.

At the end of the alleyway, a tall figure peers in your direction. You freeze in place as you and Ari share a single, desparate look. You wait for the next word or attack or anything... but it doesn&#39;t come. The guard turns away and continues his patrol. You complete the rest of your  route in silence, creeping through dark roads until you come to a heavy iron door embedded in the ground.

&quot;Uhm... $Name...? What... is this?&quot; [You give Ari a wink and crouch down beside the door.]&lt;doorCrouch|(click:?doorCrouch)[==

As you hum a gentle melody, spots of darkness flow from the shaded corners around you, pooling in the carvings of the door. 
Your song ends, and the door pops open.

&quot;After you, love.&quot; Ari only stares at you for several seconds.

&quot;You know... some day, I&#39;m going to unlock your &#39;&#39;entire&#39;&#39; dark history, but, for now, I&#39;ll go in the creepy alley hole.&quot; You follow after her, [[shutting the door behind you -&gt;creepyBar]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="creepyBar" tags="" position="4500,4200" size="100,100">Inside the cellar, the air feels warm. In the distance, music plays and voices chatter, just too distant to be comprehensible.

&quot;Uhm... $shortName... do I get to know where we&#39;re going now?&quot; Ari leans against a wall. She&#39;s smiling at you, but she seems perturbed.

&quot;Of course, of course... I figured we needed somewhere to stay. Scindos is overrun with guards right now, so my plan of... uhm... walk through the door into the capitol... probably isn&#39;t viable anymore. This was the only place I knew would be safe.&quot; You slump down next to Ariadne, she ruffles your hair and sits with you.

&quot;Oh... I&#39;m glad... but...uhm... what //are// we going to do, if we can&#39;t just enter normally...?&quot; Ari takes your hand in hers.

&quot;Well. Well. Well&quot; The call is perforated by three distinct claps. Ari reaches for her sword, but you intercept her hand. You see a figure emerges from the hallway beyond.

&quot;If it isn&#39;t the woman of the hour...&quot; A tall fiend stands in front of you, one of their hands occupied by a small towel, another two filled by two well-polished mugs. You stammer back.

&quot;O-oh... uhm, hey Alxyos... figured you&#39;d be pretty busy right now...&quot; You give the fiend an awkard grin.

&quot;Well, there&#39;s been plenty of talk about you... I thought it was just the usual Orion-Speak when they said you eloped. You never seemed the type, but...&quot; They look Ari up and down as they take a tall bottle from a shelf.
&quot;Well... either way, you&#39;re always welcome, your majesty...&quot; Alxyos gives you a mocking bow before shuffling off.

The two of you sit in silence for a bit longer. Ari speaks up.
&quot;Uhm... wanna... just keep going? I&#39;m starting to get a bit exhausted, honestly...&quot; Ariadne&#39;s eyes trail across the ground, and she keeps a blushed smile on.

&quot;Uh... that sounds good!&quot; You hop up, and take Ari&#39;s hand to lead her [[onwards -&gt;intoTheLodge]].](interrupt|</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="intoTheLodge" tags="" position="4600,4200" size="100,100">The two of you cross a long hallway and find yourselves into the main hall of Scindos&#39;s shining jewel of a secret tavern. Competition has been low for some time, but Alxyos&#39;s reputation works better than a name. As you pass by patrons, they bow with varying levels of sincerity. You keep Ari within arm&#39;s reach as you maneuver through the crowd and reach Alxyos at the bar. They grin at you.

&quot;Tsk tsk, finally decided to join us, princess?&quot; Alxyos offers you a set of twin glasses with a raised eyebrow. You refuse.

&quot;Uh, yeah... we just... needed a room for the night?&quot; Ari keeps silent beside you.

&quot;Oh? A room? How scandalous, what might the people think if they knew their darling princess-&quot; They drop silent after you bare a fang at them... Only after doing so do you notice that you //have// fangs, you... you certainly would have noticed them before, right...? 
You cover your mouth while you consider this, and Alxyos crosses the room to grab a key. Something... something feels wrong. Ari puts a hand to your cheek and gives you a worried look.

&quot;It... uh... it&#39;s probably nothing... let&#39;s not worry about it now...&quot; You&#39;ve started shaking, but Ariadne keeps a tight grip on your hand. Alxyos returns with your key.

&quot;Here you go. It&#39;s on your tab, $Name. One room for the princess and her...&quot; Alxyos trails off looking towards Ari.

[&quot;It&#39;s &#39;girlfriend&#39;, Alxyos.&quot;]&lt;geeEf|(click:?geeEf)[== 

&quot;Did they not teach you that one at the academy?&quot; You feign smugness to Alxyos, who walks off laughing, but Ari can almost definitely feel your palms sweating. You leave the bar, passing a few more scoundrels, all of whom clearly think themselves clever for sarcastically bowing to you. In the hall beyond, Ariadne stops you.

&quot;Oh, uh, yeah what&#39;s up?&quot; You give Ari a nervous smile, but she just looks at you blankly for some time.




Color drains from your face.




[&quot;Oh, uh, sorry, uh... I sh-&quot;]&lt;tag|(click:?tag)[== You&#39;re almost knocked off your feet as Ari launches into you with a hug.

You take a silent moment to appreciate the embrace, before Ari pulls away, still leaning one arm on the wall that you&#39;re pressed against.

&quot;You&#39;re... uhm... you&#39;re certain about... what you said... right?&quot; Color both returns to and //floods// your face. You fidget with your hands and hang your head.

&quot;Uh... y-yeah... If that&#39;s okay with you, I mean...&quot; Ari takes your chin in her other hand, lifting your face towards hers. She takes a beat to stare at you, her eyes full of some mix of contemplation and adoration.

&quot;Even after... uhm... everything...?&quot; You see Ariadne blush before she presses her forehead against yours to hide it. She&#39;s only got a few more seconds of this... //energy//, you&#39;d wager.

&quot;I... uh... I am...&quot; You strain to even form words with Ariadne so close.

You feel Ari&#39;s warm breath as she sighs in relief, followed by the strength of her remaining arm wrapping around you, followed //then// by her lips against your own as she leans into a long kiss. 

For a moment, the two of you stand alone from the world. Ariadne&#39;s warmth envelops you, and you bask in it wordlessly. Ari steps back to separate from you, but you pull her back in, just for a few more seconds in her arms. She obliges.



When this moment fades, Ariadne wordlessly takes your hand, and the two of you head silently towards your room. You stroke her palm with your thumb, and you smile at the faint scent of lavendar she&#39;s left on you.

[[At the end of the hall, you find your arrangements. -&gt;bedTimeInTheBar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="bedTimeInTheBar" tags="" position="4700,4200" size="100,100">The accomodations Alxyos has provided are more modest than what the Darkmoon offered, but you&#39;re just thankful to have a warm bed. 

As you laze around over the bedspread, Ariadne takes her rare chance to fully de-armor. You watch over her, feeling your head fill with honeyed thoughts and daydreams. Ari&#39;s hands move deftly over the variety of buckles and straps which keep her makeshifted full plate held together. All the armor you&#39;ve seen in The Abyss felt so... ornamental, but Ariadne&#39;s seems... alive... like a second skin for her... She catches your eye as she removes a belt holding her greaves on, and she blows you a kiss. You can&#39;t help but sigh and sink deeper into the bed.

Pared down from her armor, Ariadne slides into bed beside you, wrapping her arms around your waist. The two of you spend some time simply taking in one another&#39;s warmth, until Ari takes your chin in her hand again. You blush.

&quot;So... have we gotten any closer to understanding what&#39;s going on //here//?&quot; Ariadne pulls your lip down with her thumb, causing you to bare a fang.

&quot;I... uh... I&#39;m not entirely sure... I don&#39;t think Duercas said spontaneous fang growth was a side effect I should see...&quot; Ari laughs softly, nuzzling your cheek as she whispers.

&quot;Well... I hope you weren&#39;t planning on //doing anything// with those... well... at least not without asking first, love...&quot; Ari plants a kiss on your rapidly reddening cheeks. You hide your face under the covers, leaving only your horns exposed. Ariadne tuts at you, running her fingers through your hair.

&quot;When &#39;&#39;did&#39;&#39; these get so big, anyway... you&#39;re not one of those beautiful women who slowly transform into a ram so you can teach me a moral lesson, are you?&quot; Ari chuckles above you. You&#39;ve yet to //get// a human joke, but Ari&#39;s laugh always seems to compel you to laugh along. You poke your head back out.

&quot;I... uh... I&#39;m not actually //sure//... I guess I&#39;ve gotten used to feeling them there... They&#39;ve never grown this quickly before...&quot; You pout and Ari wraps herself around you.

&quot;I probably understand demon physiology //way// worse than I thought, but... I think they&#39;re cute... and maybe convenient, too... but mostly cute...&quot; Ari snickers, leaving a darting kiss on your neck. 

With your face twisted into a sly grin, you have an uncharacteristic moment of immense confidence. You turn to face Ari and swing your leg across the bed to straddle her. You take Ari&#39;s chin in your hand and bite your lip, perhaps a bit harder than you expected, what with fangs, and all.

&quot;They seem &#39;convenient&#39;, hmm...? Maybe you should try them out, dear...&quot; Ariadne&#39;s face goes red, but it doesn&#39;t stop her hands from wandering and running over the muscles in your back, slowly pulling you into a kiss.

When words start to fail you, you nuzzle into Ariadne&#39;s neck. You emerge for a moment, baring a fang and a raised eyebrow at Ari. She laughs shyly, but nods, pulling you back in. Your flurry of kisses are replaced with something of a tad more ferocity. You wouldn&#39;t want to hurt Ariadne in any way that could inhibit your quest, but what&#39;s an adventure where you don&#39;t gain any marks?

In a short lull, Ari pulls you up to look into your eyes. She has a blushing smile, and her nervous laughter interrupts her several times.

&quot;Uhm... $shortName... love... maybe we could...&quot; Ari&#39;s gaze falls, and she sheepishly hides her face.

You place a hand on her cheek, and open your mouth to inquire...

Ariadne comes up behind &#39;you&#39;, wrapping her arms around your waist.

&quot;Sweetheart... it sounds like you&#39;re having... well... some sort of episode... come back to bed...&quot; Ari&#39;s voice is gentle. She puts her head on your shoulder, and you wish you could come with her.

Unfortunately, you are only able to watch as &#39;you&#39;... or... whatever it is... throws Ariadne to the ground.

You want to curl in a ball and cry for at least five years. You expect Ariadne to stay down and bawl like you //know// you would, but you then feel a weight slamming into you. Ari has tackled your body and has it pinned.

&quot;Listen, $shortName... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to you, but you are &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; going out there and getting caught... not after all we&#39;ve done.&quot; Your body squirms, but Ari keeps it from moving.

Ari pulls your body towards the center of the room, giving small apologies every time it hits a bump. She pulls a coil of rope from her bag. You thank every god you&#39;ve ever heard of that you fell for the girl who carries huge amounts of rope with her.

Removing the sheets from the bed, Ari ties you down totally, attaching each of your limbs to a post of the bed. You can still feel your wrists and ankles aching, but, at least, your body struggles to move anymore. Ariadne throws a sheet over you, and lays against a wall next to the bed, throwing a blanket over her legs. She watches you with worry.

&quot;You know... $Name... I really am sorry if this hurts... I just can&#39;t risk losing you...&quot; Ari holds her head in her hands. She&#39;s tearing up.

Your body remains silent, but is still uneager to cede control back.

&quot;Well... not after a certain point...&quot; Ari eyes you, deep in thought.

After a few seconds of silence, Ariadne&#39;s eyes light up. Before you can ask what her idea is, Ari pulls the collar of her shirt to the side. You blush and stare at the ground.

&quot;Well, if you can remember... uhm... these, your memories probably end when you started acting weird...&quot; You stare at Ariadne in sheer disbelief.

&quot;I... if I **started** acting weird, you probably could have assumed that&#39;s when...... you just wanted to remind me about those, didn&#39;t you...?&quot; Ari sits next to you with a sly look.

&quot;And... I was resting on the wall when the door opened behind me... uhm... Mx. Alxyos stopped by... they said they&#39;d heard a scuffle and wanted to make sure everything was okay... I... told them everything, without even thinking about it... they came back later with that box. They said they wanted you to have it when you were feeling better...&quot; Ari gestures to a small wooden chest on the floor near her nest of blankets. 
You take it. It&#39;s... light. Inside, you find some candies, bottles of water, a map, and [[a letter-&gt;alxyosLetter]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="alxyosLetter" tags="" position="5100,4200" size="100,100">You unfurl the letter. It&#39;s written on flaky parchment, and tied in a green ribbon. The writing is shaky. It was probably rather late when they wrote it...

&quot;To the darling Princess $Name, I offer my sincerest congratulations.&quot;

&quot;I have spoken with your lover... she says you&#39;re in a sorry state... I loathe to hear that about the only royal I can tolerate.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, tomorrow, I won&#39;t be around to see you off... I&#39;ve got to make a supply run... to somewhere very far away... it&#39;s a risk I took when I chose this life.&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what will become of Scindos if these guards remain much longer... I&#39;ve had more folks in my triage the past week then in some years before... if I come back without more supplies......&quot;

&quot;Princess... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing... but I trust you... the whole town does... I&#39;ve enclosed a map... It will lead you to some old tunnels I found while expanding my stockroom... if you&#39;re heading to the core, those are your best bet.&quot;



&quot;Be safe, friend... The Abyss would be much colder without its princess. As for your human... Take care of her. She&#39;s a good one.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve included some water and sweets, I read in a book that humans need lots of those...&quot;

&quot;(Also... if we ever meet again... there&#39;ll be a round on the house if you tell me how exactly you got a human //this// deep.)&quot;

&quot;-Good luck. Yours truly, Alxyos&quot;

Ari wipes a tear from your cheek as you finish the letter.

You and Ariadne complete your routine in relative silence. Ari tosses you a syringe from her bag, and you find the greaves she kicked under the bed. You buckle Ari&#39;s breastplate together, and she dots you with some of her perfume. As Ari remakes the bed, you re-coil her rope. 
In a short time, you&#39;re both prepared to head out.

Ari stops you with an embrace.

&quot;$shortName, love, I know we&#39;re heading into a bunch of ancient tunnels at behest of your... less than scrupulous friend... but... can we end today with fewer life-threatening encounters..?&quot; You nuzzle against Ari&#39;s cheek.

The tunnels from Alxyo&#39;s stockhouse are different from any other place you&#39;ve seen in the abyss.
The walls are rough-hewn stone, and all light that might have once been has been long extinguished.

As you silently stalk these shadowed halls, Ari squeezes your hand. You squeeze hers. While you&#39;d like some light, you don&#39;t know what you might set off if you start casting. For the most part, your journey is... dark...

And then Ari&#39;s face comes into focus above you, illuminated in dim purple light which streams from strips along the walls and ceiling. You exchange a glance before Ariadne exhales and slides off of you.

Alxyos was right. 
Drawing near the capitol, you suddenly realize what you&#39;d been forgetting this entire time. You stop Ariadne with a hand on her shoulder, startling her from her traveling reverie.

&quot;Uh... Ari... could I... ask a favor of you...?&quot; She simply smiles back to you.

Ariadne cocks her head. You tap your left ear, next to your Apollonian Daisy, and she instinctively does the same before hiding her face in shame.

The wait is rather torturous.

I guess...&quot; Through the door, you can see a cozy studio, stocked with all the reagants and implements that you played with as a child. You never quite picked up the arts, but you always loved spending summers here, failing happily with your Vevere.

&quot;Oh ~nonsense~, dearie... I know we live in strange times... The spirits told me you were coming, so I made dinner for three.&quot; She gives you a wide grin as she takes off a thoroughly-dusted apron... you... did you even mention Ari was here?

&quot;Uh... wait... Vevere... three? Did your spirits.... tell you something...?&quot; All you can muster is a shy smile, but your Vevere places a frail hand on your cheek.

&quot;No, dearie, why would I trouble them with that?

You all share a moment of terrified silence.

&quot;Uhm... $Name... dearie... is she...?&quot; Your vevere raises an eyebrow. You only bow your head. She furrows her brow as she walks past you to look over a blushing Ari.

&quot;Hmmm... well, she&#39;s certainly much prettier than most of the humans I&#39;ve seen... Very strong looking... good for throne defending...&quot; Ari freezes as Vevere finishes her inspection, patting you on the back.

&quot;You definitely could have picked worse humans, dearie. I did think she&#39;d be a bit taller, but she seems like a sweetheart.

Vevere stares at the two of you with a furrowed brow, pacing around you both before coming to a stop directly by you, and whispering to you.

&quot;Dearie... you can&#39;t fool me... I know what you&#39;re doing here... don&#39;t worry about telling me.&quot; She returns to her usual smile.

&quot;But come now, you two look like you haven&#39;t even had a proper married dinner yet, come on in...&quot; Vevere leads. Ari gives you a worried glance, but you return a smile, [[leading her inside-&gt;dinnerTime]].](if: $introIndex is 3)[Ari gives a deep bow.

&quot;Madame, I am... uhm... Ariadne... th-the future queen of The Abyss!&quot; If she were anyone but herself, you&#39;d hold out hope that this was a scheme and not just Ari&#39;s people skills at work. Your Vevere gives Ariadne an inquisitive look while you sit in silence.

&quot;Well, she seems nice. Now you two come for dinner, just because you&#39;re the queens doesn&#39;t mean you get to skip meals.&quot; Vevere winks at you.

Vevere waits in silence for a few seconds, peering both of you up and down.

&quot;... and then I figured, well, my $Name will probably come by to receive the Arms sometime soon, so I&#39;ve been sticking around... waiting...&quot; 

Vevere trails off and your brow furrows. The Arms...? You feel like you //should// know what she means... but you can&#39;t remember why...

You wander out... past the Ashroot... past it all... you doubt this place will be safe for long.

The lodge&#39;s interior has always had a strange chill throughout it. You lay Ariadne down on a cushion and begin a low hum, stoking a fire in the old hearth. Ari stirs from the cold of your absence, and you hear her sigh to herself. The logs burst into a crackling black flame, and you look over to see Ari watching you, her grinning face propped up in her hands.

You laugh to yourself at the image of Ari lugging your unconscious body around to find a &#39;&#39;suitable&#39;&#39; bed... As if any bed could be unsuitable with her in it next to you...

&quot;I... uhm... wanted to surprise you more with them, but... uhm... I figured that might upset you... so... here you go...&quot; Ari blushedly slides the bundle to you, and you pull on the knot at its top, spreading its contents out.


...


&quot;Books...? Where... where did you get all these...?&quot; You feel a smile cross your face. Ari stares at you through her hands.

&quot;So... uhm... there //might// have been a secret little alcove I found which was full of books (text-style: &quot;superscript&quot;)[and also maybe a sword which I... kinda took...] and... I figured... since you said you spent a long time in the King&#39;s library... maybe you had been missing out on reading while you&#39;ve been with me...&quot; You pry a hand from Ari&#39;s blushing face and give it a brief kiss.

&quot;This is... lovely... thank you so much, Ariadne...&quot; You&#39;re just... astounded. Ari wraps her arms around you.

&quot;I... uhm... sorry... just... the look on your face when you saw it was... uhm... really cute... I just...&quot; Ari laughs nervously, and you counter, pulling her up into your lap and nuzzling into her neck.

&quot;Tsk, tsk... you adventurer types just have a knack for finding treasure, huh?&quot; Ari sighs and sinks into your arms.

&quot;You... could certainly say that... $shortName...&quot;

There aren&#39;t that many you&#39;ve heard of... but you&#39;ve got a peculiar idea to spruce the selection up. You dislodge Ariadne from her home in your neck, and her eyes flutter open with a smile.

&quot;Love... maybe we could check one of these out together...? I figured, since I&#39;ve read most of them, it might be fun...&quot; Ari gives you a quizzical head tilt.

&quot;Uhm... are we talking, like, you serenade me with sweet poetry, magically surrounding me in flower petals as a sunbeam streams down on me... or... like... you lecture me from a history book all day?&quot; You peer over to the pile of books.

...


The two of you spend the next hours, staging readings of short fragments of poetry, each ending with one of you falling, laughing, into the other&#39;s arms. 

In a particularly melodramatic piece, Ari gets caught into some footwork and pulls you up for an impromptu waltz.

&quot;Oh, my muse... might I...?&quot; Ari bites her lip with her eyebrow raised at you. She takes you blush as her answer, twirling you into her dance.

Soon enough, you&#39;ve both forgotten about the poetry altogether, focusing instead on your footwork and one another. You struggle to keep up without any music, but Ari adjusts to meet you.

Then, she starts humming to her imaginary backing track. She starts softly, but increasing in vigor as you stare to her in amazement.

[Then you start as well,]&lt;humGat|(click:?humGat)[== unsure at first, but you feed off one another&#39;s energy, and the lights around the room react, swelling and encircling your dance. The music flows through you, the Aether spilling forth to enshroud you both in ethereal light. You spin Ari, and she catches onto you, pulling you close and smirking up towards you.

&quot;Quite a showing, princess.&quot; You laugh, brushing a lock from her face.

&quot;What can I say? You can&#39;t &#39;&#39;always&#39;&#39; be the extra one, darling.&quot; Ari only chuckles.

&quot;Au contraire, beloved.&quot; With a wink, she spins you outwards. She opposes your movements in a series of quick twirls, filling the whole space with an elaborate web.

And then, you collide.

And then, she dips you towards the ground, holding your face inches from her own. The ethereal glow gives her a corona of bright light, and you are &#39;&#39;dumbstruck&#39;&#39;.

And then, she kisses you... and the lights surrounding you both collapse into the ground... and then she pulls away. You both sit in breathless silence for several minutes... Ari peers over you with a smug grin...

Ari wordlessly lays you down, sitting next to you to pout into her hands. You pull yourself up to whisper to her.

&quot;Y&#39;know... you really are just the &#39;&#39;most&#39;&#39; sometimes, $shortName...&quot; Ari smiles up towards you, and you feel a grin cross your face.

&quot;Oh I know... and I also know that you keep coming back for more...&quot; For a beat, Ari smirks up towards you. In the next moment, she throws a leg across you, straddling your waist and whispering to you.

&quot;Yeah...? And what if I **really** want more, $splitName...?&quot; The air around you feels //thick//, and Ari dots your face with slow kisses between your labored breaths.

&quot;I... I would... very much like that... uh... yes...&quot; Ari throws her arms around your neck, leaving a brief kiss on your cheek. (show:?hhhItIsTime)](sapphicR| [With a smirk on your face, you grab a thick tome of ancient history.

&quot;You... you&#39;re really... well... okay, I guess...&quot; Ari stretches out, wresting on her elbows, and pouts.


...


For the first couple of chapters, Ari tries to keep her full attention on your words, mostly sitting up when the author takes tangents to describe the ancient&#39;s technological progression, but, halfway through your retelling of the Fourth Siege of Aytos, Ari grabs a pillow to scream into.

&quot;$shortName(print:$shortName&#39;s last)(print:$shortName&#39;s last)(print:$shortName&#39;s last)(print:$shortName&#39;s last)~... I&#39;m gonna dieeee~... &#39;&#39;How many&#39;&#39; of these battles could your ancestors have //hadddd//...?&quot; Ari swaddles herself in a large blanket and feigns fainting into your arms.

&quot;Well, Ari... spend a couple days around my dad and you&#39;d wonder how we ever &#39;&#39;stopped&#39;&#39;...&quot; Ari throws her arms over your neck, and pulls in to kiss your cheek.

&quot;I mean... okay... point taken, but, if we finish this, I think I deserve a degree... or something...&quot; You laugh and pull Ari closer to you.

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that, love...&quot; 

You continue, rattling off history as the core&#39;s sun arcs down from its zenith. Each time you pass the story of a famous battle, Ari pulls in close to leave tiny kisses along your cheek and neck. 

When you rattle off the battle formations used in the Battle of Embroes, you catch her, meeting her lips with your own.

Ari pulls away on instinct, blushing and nuzzling back into your shoulder. You turn the page, and spot &quot;The Siege of Keiete&quot; on the corner of the next page. Your breath gets heavy in anticipation.

You reach the text&#39;s description of the siege. Ari strikes quickly, but you&#39;re more than ready for that. Your lips reach hers, and your arm follows in a pincer maneuver, supporting Ari by the small of her back. You separate, and Ari smirks at you, biting her lip. You each take a few warm breaths of one another&#39;s air.

[And then you riposte.]&lt;hegDac|(click:?hegDac)[==

Your lips are back on hers. The tome drops to the floor, and straight from your awareness. For a single moment, you wordlessly scream your hunger into one another...

And then she&#39;s underneath you, and your finger traces slowly from her chin to the collar of her tunic. Ari melts at your touch... but she stays your hand with a kiss, pulling herself up to whisper in your ear.

&quot;Uhm... beloved...?&quot; You heart sinks. You move to give her space, but Ari coils her arms around you.


...



&quot;$shortName, darling... would you like to move this...&quot; She bites her lip and bucks her head towards the master bedroom. You immediately gain &#39;&#39;full&#39;&#39; self-consciousness, blushedly falling to the floor with Ari still in your embrace.

A voice rings out.

&quot;$Name... I understand... I... I&#39;ve been in the place you are before... or... close to it...&quot; A single sob escapes your throat. You can hear Ari come closer to the door.

&quot;I want you to know that... that whatever you&#39;re scared of... It isn&#39;t true... I... I &#39;&#39;love&#39;&#39; you... I love you so much... and... I... I promise... that isn&#39;t going to change... and... I just... I hope I can help...&quot; You... you can hear tears in her voice...

&quot;Yes, dearest?&quot; Her eyes sparkle in the warm lamplight... and... you feel your thoughts slowing back down... and you bury your face in her shoulder. Ari keeps you held tight, guiding you towards the main room, where she sits you by the fire... the warmth reaches deep into your soul.

&quot;Absolutely not. I&#39;ll have no talk of it, darling... Don&#39;t try to apologize when you&#39;ve done nothing wrong.&quot; You... don&#39;t have the energy to fight that... so you relent and the two of you simply lay together.

&quot;I love you too, Ari... now... are &#39;&#39;you&#39;&#39; ready for this?&quot; Ari pulls away and smirks at you.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Does this answer your question, dearest?&quot; With a bite of her lip, Ari swings her cloak over her head... and... you suddenly find it very hard to breath normally. She laughs and places a coy kiss on your flushed cheek.

&quot;Come now, princess...&quot; Ari tugs upwards at the collar of your blouse and raises an eyebrow. Some nervous laughter spills out, and you nod.

&quot;This is simply not befitting of your station. We //must// get you out of this...&quot; Ari leans against you, and the two of you go horizontal. You both laugh. Ari kisses your neck, and you embrace.

While Ari is in a lull, you roll over, suspending yourself just over her. You lift Ari&#39;s chin with a lone, clawed finger, and laugh.

&quot;You&#39;re such an idiot, Ari...&quot; You descend, nipping at Ari&#39;s ear and whispering to her.

&quot;And a lucky one, at that... if I weren&#39;t in such a tender mood right now... there would be nothing stopping me from splintering this bed here and now...&quot; You pull back from her, and snap open the top button of your blouse without breaking eye contact. Ari smirks.

She advances, wrapping an arm around to support the small of your back. She dips you down and whispers.

&quot;I like that tone, princess... but I get the feeling you&#39;re all talk...&quot; She tilts your head backwards to kiss your neck. With her free hand, she snaps open your bottom button. A grin creeps across your face.

You sweep a leg outwards, straddling Ari&#39;s thigh.

&quot;And what makes you so certain, beloved?&quot; You bare a fang and feel Ari&#39;s entire body shudder beneath you. You bend down to leave a mark below her collarbone, and your penultimate button falls open.

Ari runs her trembling fingers through your hair.

&quot;I know you a-all too well, dear... your heart is too big to hurt me in any way I&#39;d enjoy.&quot; Ari smirks, and tugs your collar upwards... and your entire blouse comes flying off... landing halfway across the room. Ari looks down to you, and her eyes go wide. You meet her gaze and lick your lips, summoning out your fangs.


Ari immediately rolls to her side, burying her face in a pillow and blaspheming against dozens of gods whose names you&#39;ve never heard. You collapse beside her in fitful laughter, wrapping your arms around her waist. You pull yourself towards Ari and nuzzle against her neck.


When Ari finishes screaming into her pillow, she turns towards you, pressing your foreheads together. You linger over one another. You drape Ari&#39;s skin in soft kisses and she traces a finger from your cheek to your collarbone, blushing noticeably near the end.

You smirk and lay backwards, arching upwards and staring into Ari&#39;s eyes. Her eyes dart around and she purses her lips.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, be~love~d~? Cat got your tongue?&quot; For a moment among your laughter, your eyes shut, and you immediately feel a weight land against your chest. You look up, and Ari is on top of you. She holds your wrists gingerly, with a smirk and raised eyebrow. You spill out in nervous laughter and nod to her. She pins your wrists against the bedframe.

&quot;Oh dear, princess... what a sticky situation you find yourself in...&quot; She brushes your cheek with her free hand as she sways her weight across you. You take a silent moment to... appreciate... your circumstances... but then your Hare-Brained-Scheme Cortex goes haywire, and your eyes light up. Ari bites her lip and stares down to you with adoration.

&quot;You&#39;re scheming, aren&#39;t you, dearest?&quot; She gives a rich laugh and tilts your chin upwards to her gaze. Your face flushes.

&quot;Oh... you know... nothing too big... I just figured... since you&#39;re ~//traveling with//~ the Abyssal Princess and one of the most talented Abyssal sorceresses... maybe you&#39;d like an experience that&#39;s a tad more... eccentric?&quot; You bite your lip, and your eyes fall. Ari&#39;s spare hand drifts downwards to brush over your throat.

&quot;Oh? Is even this not eccentric enough for your royal tastes, your high~ness~&quot; Ari smirks down to you, but you sit silently with a raised eyebrow, already starting a low hum.

&quot;Gods... okay, yeah, you&#39;re right... please do proceed. Uhm, do you need your hands for this darling?&quot; You interrupt your channeling with a snort and fall forwards in laughter.

&quot;Not yet, darling... but they&#39;ll have their time to shine.&quot; You continue your melody, and tendrils of shadow dance from all corners of the room. One by one, the blot out stripes of light above you. Ari pulls in closer, nuzzling against your neck.

This would usually be a detriment, but you&#39;re thoroughly acquainted with all the winding curves of Ari&#39;s form. 

She squeezes your hand, and you return the gesture. When Ariadne places a gentle kiss upon your neck, you feel all your minor senses swelling to the sensitivity of those you&#39;ve lost. 

Ari&#39;s lips graze your skin as if you might crumble to dust beneath her affection. You bear down upon her, laying a deep kiss below her collarbone and letting her warmth wash over you. Beneath you, Ariadne smells faintly of honeysuckle and sweat, an aroma you&#39;d once find grating. It only deepens your want.

You guide Ari through the dark, trailing a finger up her tender skin to bring her towards you. Her lips find yours, and you fall deep into one another.

Hidden in the tenebrous mist, it becomes unclear where Ariadne begins and $Name ends. The boundaries between your accurse and warm flesh is blurred in a sea of grasping hands and wandering tongues. Your panting breath ripples across the dark tides, but they are reduced to nothing by Ari&#39;s frantic gasping.

Ari shudders against you, and you envelope her with your form. You bind her as her tremors reach a steady tempo. As Ari&#39;s breathing becomes more erratic beneath you, her frenzied kisses mix with sharp spots of euphoric ache. You coil your free hand through Ari&#39;s hair to ground yourself against her.

When Ari&#39;s gasping spasms finally die down, your errant hands wrap her in an embrace as spots of light creep into the world above. Once again, you see Ari beside you... her breathing comes to a stable rhythm as she melts into your arms.

Your mouth moves before your thoughts command it.


&quot;Okay...&quot; Ari gasps, pulling back from your embrace. You give her a weak smile, and she clasps her hands over her mouth.

For a single moment, the artificial moonlight streaming through the room&#39;s sole window surrounds Ari in a radiant aurora. You... you have so many things you need to tell her.

You need to tell her how scared you are to risk her life against Orion.

You need to tell her about all your dreams for your future together.

You need to tell her just how many kings you&#39;d face just to keep her safe.

You need to thank whichever kindly god saw fit to bundle all the stars in that distant, forbidden sky and bring them here to gaze upon you tonight.


Instead, you simply take her hand and pull her up onto the side of the bed.

&quot;No risks tomorrow, okay...?&quot; Ari laughs and wipes a lone tear.

&quot;Of course, $shortName... No tricks, no gambits... no heroic sacrifices. That goes for you, too.&quot; She smirks at you. You laugh, wiping the last of your tears.

&quot;Of course, dummy... I love you too much for that. What&#39;s the point of winning if we don&#39;t get to celebrate together?&quot; Ari stares at you for a moment before breaking into laughter.

You act before you even realize what&#39;s happened. You rip off your gag and scream out a trill note, wrapping your body in bright light.

You stand, and Orion groans.

&quot;You just //never// give up, do you, princeling...? What a shame.&quot; Orion is occupied, for only a moment, retrieving //something// from a chest beside his throne. You waste no time, dashing to Ari and lifting her into your protection. Behind you, Soren falls to the ground and writhes.

You look to him, and he gives you a resolute nod. You turn towards Orion, loosing Ari&#39;s restraints as you move. 

With a few hundred feet between you... Orion finds what he was looking for... and he laughs. You freeze up and watch him hoist a black sigil, carved into shimmering golden metal.

&quot;What a shame... She was a great captain... but... I guess we have more vital matters to attend to...&quot; Orion&#39;s face twists into a grin and you feel your blood boiling.

[&quot;Stop it...! This... this ends here... I won&#39;t let you hurt us anymore...&quot;]&lt;noStop|(click:?noStop)[== Orion tuts at you.

&quot;Oh, my child... I won&#39;t &#39;&#39;need&#39;&#39; to.&quot; Your breathing falters for a moment.

&quot;I&#39;m no fool. I know when I&#39;ve been had. Luckily, I can make the most of this.&quot; He feebly attempts to stand, leaning his back against the throne.

&quot;If you want me dead... if you want the throne... Prove me wrong.&quot; He laughs, and you launch yourself forward, your eyes dead set on Orion.

[Then your legs give out]&lt;hr|(click:?hr)[==, and Ari falls from your arms. Past you, you see Orion bending the sigil with his grip.

&quot;I can&#39;t stop you if your heart is truly in it, princeling... but, if you want to rid yourself of me...&quot; He trails off, deforming the rune more. Color starts to fade from the edge of the room, and you feel the air heating up around you.

&quot;You must be prepared for bloodshed...&quot; The room around you bursts into pillars of black flame. Your senses fade from you. Ari rushes to your side and turns you over. Orion laughs.

&quot;What a pity... to destroy or be destroyed by the thing you love most... I&#39;d shed a tear if I still could...&quot; Ari pulls your head into her lap, and shakes you.

&quot;$shortName... No, no, no, $Name... Come on... stay with me...&quot; The fires close in, encircling you both. You can barely force a hand up to touch Ari&#39;s face. You can&#39;t feel her there.

&quot;Gods... $shortName... please, hang in there... I... I don&#39;t know what to do, but I&#39;m going to get us out of this...&quot; A tear rolls from her cheek and lands on your own. You can&#39;t make out color anymore.

&quot;I... I won&#39;t let him do this to you... I... I don&#39;t know what to do... but... I won&#39;t let it end here... I&#39;m taking you back to the surface, $Name... No matter what.&quot; A tear falls from your face. Without your control, your hand wanders down from Ari&#39;s cheek.



And it wraps around her throat.

You don&#39;t know why, but you feel tears on your cheeks. You hear the door swing open and you stand on instinct.

Orion walks in.

He stands directly in front of you, his arms crossed.

&quot;Did you think you could escape punishment by hiding out here, (text-style: &quot;upside-down&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;mirror&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;blurrier&quot;)[&#96;&lt;&#96;0s♂2δsd&#96;&gt;&#96;]?&quot; You stutter out.

&quot;No sir, I-&quot; You feel Orion&#39;s claws drag against your cheek.

&quot;Don&#39;t speak out of turn, child... Maybe, had you learned to watch your tongue, you wouldn&#39;t be here in the first place.&quot; You fall and back yourself against the frame of your bed.

&quot;This can&#39;t continue, young prince...  You&#39;ll never amount to anything if you can&#39;t listen...&quot; Orion raises his arm, and you shield your eyes.

The air crackles around you.

The strike never comes. You look up.

Between you and Orion, there is a woman... She seems to blend into the shadows, but you can see a faint, purple outline surrounding her. Her hand is around Orion&#39;s arm, which is wreathed in black fire. Time seems to stop.

Once inside, your formal guard is reduced to only Solen. Your shackles are exchanged for much heavier bindings. Your arms are mostly stuck in place as you approach the center of the palace.

Stygia lays a hand on your cheek, and you see her eyes go wide.

Then, Orion moves out from under you, and Stygia is cradling you. 

Despire the circumstances... her smile is sweet. She keeps you held close, doting over your fragile form.

&quot;I do hope you&#39;ll forgive me for that... $Name...&quot; Your body tries to stand, but Ari lays a boot on your chest.

Ariadne drops down, pinning you by your shoulders and staring tearfully into your eyes.

&quot;Because I&#39;m &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; leaving here without you...&quot; 

Ari pulls in close, pressing her forehead to your own. Your body relaxes, seeming to finally give in. Your arms fall, wrapping gently around Ariadne...



...




And then your claws come out, and they rake down the length of Ari&#39;s back as your body flips over to straddle her again.

Ari stares up into your eyes and freezes... Your body peers around, rolling the Royal Arms into its hand. Ariadne coughs and limply reaches upwards towards you. Your body grabs her arm with its clawed offhand.

&quot;$shortName... I know you&#39;re still in there... It&#39;s like I said... I know your heart&#39;s too big to really hurt me...&quot; Ari&#39;s voice fades into coughs. You push against everything your body does... but you can&#39;t even slow it.



It raises the Arms aloft, and it growls a single note.

Around you, the dark flame walls begin to turn inwards, spiraling towards the room&#39;s center.

Tendrils of black fire seep inwards, pooling at the front end of the Royal Arms and stretching out to form a blade of flames. 



Your cheeks are streaked with tears, but your body points the blade downwards, directly over Ariadne&#39;s heart. You scream out, but your voice has been stolen.

You peer down, looking into Ari&#39;s eyes...


And...



She smiles.

The first thing to appear in your vision is Ari’s face above you. She strokes your cheek with her thumb, and you quickly notice her other hand wandering, trailing across your skin. She’s pared down to only a light cloak, and you’ve been reduced even further.

You freeze up, and Ariadne sits still, before throwing both of her arms around your neck and nuzzling your cheek.

“$shortName, beloved. Is everything alright?” She rests her head on yours.

&quot;I don&#39;t know... It sort of feel like... I&#39;m just waiting for my future to start... and it just keeps slipping between my fingers...&quot; Ari stares for a moment, and she pulls herself to you, pressing her forehead against yours.

&quot;Hey... $shortName... we&#39;ll figure it out, okay...?&quot;

You sigh and wrap your arms around her.

&quot;Okay... We&#39;ll get it, eventually...&quot; You lay in silence with Ari, holding onto her. It feels like... home, maybe...

&quot;Ah... that old stunt...&quot; A lump forms in your throat. You... you can&#39;t look into her eyes.



There are a few moments of palpable silence between the two of you.





Then you feel Ari kiss your cheek, and you&#39;re in her arms. Her voice is a low whisper.

&quot;$shortName... It&#39;s &#39;&#39;okay&#39;&#39;...&quot; You turn around, and Ari is watching you with tears in her eyes. She pulls your head onto her shoulder.

You lay down, and Ari comes down beside you. The two of you lay together, wiping one another&#39;s tears and each doting on the other with promises and adoration.

Ari tires herself out pretty quickly, and soon, you&#39;re lying awake with her gently dozing on your chest.

&quot;I&#39;m //well// aware of that, $splitName...&quot; Your entire body shudders, and Ari leaves a mocking kiss on your cheek.



Ari&#39;s hand trails from your cheek, gliding down your neck, lingering over your heart, and stopping below your breast, where she traces over a wide scar. You haven&#39;t felt its presence in some time, but you can feel Ari&#39;s fingers running back and forth over the length of it.

Then, you hear Ari&#39;s breathing falter, and you feel her lips on your skin. You look down, and Ari has wrapped her arms around you. You place a hand on her back, and she looks up, tears streaming down her cheeks. Ari immediately lunges, burying her sniffling face into your neck and melting into your arms.

Your breath is slow and heavy, but you jolt as Ari grabs your chin, shooting up towards you and pulling your bottom lip down with her thumb.

&quot;Geez, Daeme... It&#39;s going to be okay... I can come back once my training is done...&quot; You want to speak... but... your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth. You relent and sit back, sniffling occasionally.

&quot;Exactly... &#39;&#39;That&#39;&#39; is why I need you to promise something to me, Daeme... When I&#39;m gone...&quot; Euphie&#39;s gaze falls, and she takes a deep breath.

&quot;While I&#39;m gone... I need you to take care of Ari for me... okay?&quot; You... feel ill... but you nod. Euphemia steps away, and she takes a wistfully look into the distance.

&quot;The people in the village... They&#39;ll probably never change, b-but that&#39;s why we have eachother... a-and... that&#39;s why I need you to promise to me, Daeme... I can&#39;t feed Ari to the wolves like that... so... promise?&quot; Euphemia reaches her hand out.

Then, you hear bushes rustling. Euphie and you both jump to attention... but... from the bushes... well... you can easily recognize her face.

Ari bursts into the clearing, snickering and showing off a satchel. She lays it on a log beside you both. Euphemia moves to sit with you and gives Ari a concerned stare. 

&quot;So... um... what&#39;s in the bag, love?&quot; Ari reaches into the satchel, pulling out a cloth, with three indistinct lumps in it.

&quot;Well... I figured I should bring a treat, since you&#39;re both so hard at work practicing...&quot; You and Euphie share a single glance before turning back to Ari, who has unwrapped a wooden platter of pastries.

&quot;Soooo... I borrowed a few extra //bouga// from Hagne&#39;s place... Just... uhm... don&#39;t tell her...&quot; Ari makes a show of it, curtsying to give Euphemia a bouga, as well as a brief peck on the cheek. When she comes to you, Ari puts a finger to her cheek and furrows her brow.

&quot;Uhm... Daemi... you... you &#39;&#39;can&#39;&#39; eat normal food, right...?&quot; The three of you sit in silence for a moment, then you and Euphie both double over in laughter. Ari pouts, leaving your bouga beside you, and, once you&#39;ve recovered, you thank her.

For a beautiful moment, the three of you lay, watching the sky above, ruining your clothes with crumbs, and forgetting the worries of the world for some time...



Once Ariadne has audibly nodded off, you look down and meet Euphemia&#39;s gaze. She holds onto Ari as if either of them could shatter at any moment. 

Euphie looks up to you with tears beginning in her eyes. A single, questioning word falls hoarsely from her lips, and you tremble.

Your mind races...



All of this... maybe it always led back here...

The throne... Orion... Stygia...

Maybe your destiny started &#39;&#39;here&#39;&#39; all along...

&quot;Hey... ready to head out, $senName- uhm... I mean, $shortName...&quot; You snicker and wrap an arm around her.

&quot;Watch out, beloved. Sola&#39;s brain poisoning powers have already started working. You&#39;re not developing an obsession with pastry or pathological thalassophobia, are you?&quot; Ari chokes on a sip of water, and looks up in disbelief.

&quot;How can you be afraid of the ocean if you&#39;ve never even seen it?&quot; You both fall into fitful laughter. 

By the time either of you has fully recovered, the foliage clears up overhead, and Ari&#39;s smile drops.




&quot;Uhm... we&#39;re here.&quot; Ari leads you to a flat stone at the center of the clearing, pulling a bouquet of sword lillies and purple carnations from her bag. You both kneel, and you clasp a hand to Ari&#39;s back. She sighs. Her voice is barely above a choked whisper.

&quot;We... uhm... we never really got to give Euphie a real burial... So I&#39;ve just been coming here... It&#39;s distant enough that nobody will bother the place...&quot; You lay a hand on the warm stone, and Ari rests her head on your shoulder.

Once again, you find yourself on a battlefield... but... this time, Orion is directly beside you.

Your muscles tense, but your body doesn&#39;t respond. Your eyes wander down, and you see your hands clasped around the Royal Arms, directly above Orion&#39;s grip.

Your arms move without your control, directing Orion&#39;s blackflame blade as it launches waves of dark fire past his armies.

Then... in the distance...



You see a blinding, radiant light, and your body suddenly feels heavy. You fall backwards, causing the Arms&#39;s blade to sputter into nothing. You hide your face in your hands, which continuously fade into shadows and coalesce into your own form.

The light only grows, until all the armies around have retreated, and a single form towers over you. You look beyond your hands, and you see a pair of dark eyes staring down at you. Your breathing shortens. The figure beyond you grimaces, balling her hand into a fist, and she turns.

You reach out towards her, your claws subsumed by shadow... but she continues walking... and, soon enough, you&#39;re alone, save for a field littered with corpses and fires...

Inside your game&#39;s install folder, there&#39;s a hidden archive containing a bit of //bonus content//, such as some cutting room floor stuff and, most importantly, a guide that would help if you want to do multiple runs.

None of it is really super important, but here&#39;s how you find it.

Windows or Linux:
	Navigate to your main install folder (//ThePrinceIsDead//).
	The relevant file will be called //nw_50.pak//
Mac:
	Open the //Contents// Subfolder of //ThePrinceIsDead.app//.
	The relevant file will be called //jcNss// with no file extension.
	
All OS:
	This file is actually a .zip archive. Inside it are nested two &#39;&#39;additional&#39;&#39; zip archives. 
	The passwords to access them should be self explanatory now, so I&#39;ll leave that part to you.
